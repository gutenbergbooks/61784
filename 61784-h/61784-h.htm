<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The fame of the brave outlives him; his portion is immortality.&rdquo;
<span class="jr"><i>From the funeral discourse pronounced over Paul Jones.</i></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The writer feels the most sincere diffidence in making
use of the mighty name and personality of Paul Jones,
who, as Cooper justly says, was not only a great seaman
but a great man. An excuse, however, is not wanting.
It is justifiable and profitable to bring before the eyes of
American youth this heroic figure, and if it be done inadequately,
the fault is not in the intention. It is not
too much to say that the achievements of Paul Jones, the
ranking officer in the Continental marine, had much to
do with placing the American navy upon that lofty
plane of skill and intrepidity which can only be matched
by England, the Mistress of the Seas.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_vi">vi</div>
<p>Strangely enough, Paul Jones is but little known to
the multitude, and the misrepresentations concerning him
that occasionally appear in print to this day are the more
inexcusable because few public men ever left a more complete
record. This record has been carefully studied by
the writer, and, although this story is professedly and confessedly
a romance, history has been consulted at every
point. Log books, journals, and biographies have been
searched, especially the logs, journals, and letters of Paul
Jones himself. Much relating to him has been left out,
but nothing of consequence has been put in that is not
historically true. The language ascribed to him is, whenever
possible, that used by him at the time, or afterward,
in his letters and journals. When it is wholly imaginary
it is made consistent, as far as lies in the writer&rsquo;s power,
with what is known of his mode of expression. The
mere recital of Paul Jones&rsquo;s actual adventures is a thrilling
romance, and his character was so powerfully romantic
and imaginative that it lends itself readily to idealization.
But he is more than the type of mere daring. Technical
authors write of him with the most profound admiration,
and among naval men of all nations he stands as the
model of resource as well as boldness. His plans were
far-reaching, and his most hazardous undertakings were
inspired by a sublime common sense. John Adams said
of him: &ldquo;If I could see a prospect of half a dozen line-of-battle
ships under the American flag and commanded by
Commodore Paul Jones engaged with an equal British
force, I apprehend the result would be so glorious for
the United States, and lay so sure a foundation for their
prosperity, that it would be a rich compensation for the
continuance of the war.&rdquo; And Franklin, his steadfast
friend, in one noble sentence described him: &ldquo;<i>For Captain
Paul Jones ever loved close fighting.</i>&rdquo; Washington,
Lafayette, Jefferson, and Morris esteemed him, and left
evidence of it. Nor did his enemies fail to pay him
the compliment of wishing to ruin him, for at one time
there were forty-two British frigates and line-of-battle
ships scouring the seas for him. He was the first to
raise the American flag on the ocean, and so well did
he maintain its honor that he kept it flying in the Texel,
with thirteen double-decked Dutch frigates menacing him
in the harbor, while twelve British ships lay in wait for him
outside. He was offered comparative security if he would
hoist the French ensign and accept a commission in the
French navy. More than that, he was told that unless he
agreed to this he must give up the splendid trophy of
his valor, the captured British frigate Serapis&mdash;&ldquo;the
finest ship of her class I ever saw,&rdquo; he wrote. But cruel
as this last alternative was, Paul Jones unhesitatingly
transferred his flag from the beautiful Serapis to the inferior
Alliance and got to sea in the face of the British
fleet, with his &ldquo;best American ensign flying,&rdquo; as he himself
wrote at the moment. Well might Paul Jones say
proudly to the American Congress: &ldquo;I have never borne
arms under any but the American flag, nor have I ever
borne or acted under any commission except that of the
Congress of America.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_vii">vii</div>
<p>He served without pay or allowance, and made advances
out of his private fortune to the cause of independence.
He was wounded many times in his &ldquo;twenty-three
battles and solemn rencounters by sea,&rdquo; as he expressed
it. Yet there is not one word of his wounds in
any line of his official correspondence, although the
wounds of others are frequently called to the attention of
the Congress. He fought whenever he had a chance, and
he was never defeated. The two British war-ships he
captured were taken in the face of enormous odds and
within sight of the three kingdoms, when both seas and
shores were swarming with his enemies. The captain
who surrendered to him was made a baronet for the defense
of the British ship. What, then, must have been
the splendor of the attack! Truly, Paul Jones deserved
well of his country, and he was not without proof of its
gratitude. He was unanimously elected the ranking officer
of the American navy by the Continental Congress,
which also gave him a gold medal and the thanks of Congress.
France showed her appreciation of his services by
awarding him the cross of the order of Military Merit,
never before given a foreigner, and a gold sword. Thus
was the splendid roll of American sea officers made
lustrous from the beginning by the name of Paul Jones.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_viii">viii</div>
<p>The words of Lamartine about the great profession in
which Paul Jones served gloriously, and the language of
Cooper regarding Paul Jones himself, may be quoted.
Lamartine says: &ldquo;Among the illustrious men who have
filled the foremost ranks in great contests, men have always
been most dazzled and interested by the heroes of
the sea.... The variety and extent of natural and acquired
faculties which must of necessity be united in one
individual to constitute a great seaman, astonish the mind
and raise the perfect sailor beyond all comparison above
all other warriors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cooper says: &ldquo;In battle, Paul Jones was brave; in
enterprise, hardy and original; in victory, mild and generous;
in motives, much disposed to disinterestedness, although
ambitious of renown and covetous of distinction;
in his pecuniary relations, liberal; in his affections, natural
and sincere; and in his temper, except in those cases
which assailed his reputation, just and forgiving.&rdquo; Moreover,
he was a true and patriotic American, and, except
Columbus, the Admiral of the Ocean Seas, Paul Jones
was the very boldest man who ever sailed blue water.</p>

<h2 id="c2"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER I.</span></h2>
<p>On a bright day in January, 1776, a lithe, handsome
young man, wearing the uniform of a lieutenant in the
Continental navy, stood on the dock at Philadelphia
gazing keenly down the river. His eyes were peculiarly
black and beautiful, and had an expression of command
in them that is seldom absent from those of a man born to
lead other men. His figure was slight, and he was not
above medium height; but he was both graceful and
muscular.</p>
<p>The river was frozen, except a tortuous channel cut
through the ice and kept open with difficulty. Innumerable
masts and spars made a network against the
dull blue of the winter sky, and fringed the docks and
wharves; while far down the glittering sea of ice lay a
small squadron of five armed vessels, which was the beginning
of the glorious navy of the United States.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_2">2</div>
<p>This young lieutenant, Paul Jones by name, looked
about for a boat to take him down the river to the squadron;
and seeing a ragged, bright-eyed boy about twelve
years old sitting in a rickety skiff from which a passenger
had just been landed, he called the boy, and, jumping
lightly into the boat, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take me to that ship over yonder with &lsquo;Alfred&rsquo;
painted on her stern.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy pulled away with a will, but kept his eyes
fixed on Paul Jones&rsquo;s uniform and the sword which lay
across his knee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Them ships is to fight the British, ain&rsquo;t they?&rdquo; he
asked presently, jerking his head toward the ships then
just collected in the river, whose crews and armaments
were yet to be provided.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Paul Jones, smiling. &ldquo;If you were
a man I would enlist you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy said nothing more, but pulled steadily toward
the Alfred. When they reached the side of the ship her
decks were heaped with coils of rope, piles of shot, some
unmounted guns, and all the litter of a merchant vessel
being converted into a man-of-war. But the Alfred, although
not built for fighting, was yet a stanch little ship,
and when armed and manned had no cause to run away
from any vessel of her class.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_3">3</div>
<p>Paul Jones studied her with the eye of a seaman, as
they approached. Meanwhile a crowd of strange thoughts
rushed upon him. &ldquo;At last,&rdquo; he thought to himself, &ldquo;I
am at the beginning of my career. A poor Scotch gardener&rsquo;s
son, shipping as a common sailor boy because
there were so many mouths to feed at home&mdash;coming, at
thirteen, to this new country that I have learned to love
so well&mdash;left a modest fortune, and rising to the command
of a ship before I was twenty, I determined to cast my fate
with these people, to whom I owe all the kindness I ever
knew, and I was proud to be among the first to raise my
arm in the defense of these colonies against tyranny. All
those I loved as a child in Scotland are dead, and all that
is now dear to me is in my adopted country. The cause
of these colonies is a just one, and I could no more refuse
to fight for that cause than any man born here. The
chances for success and promotion are all with the army;
our few small vessels can hope for but little in contests
with England, the Mistress of the Seas; but I think I was
born a sailor, and my heart turns ever toward blue water.
The day that I received my commission as a lieutenant in
the Continental navy was surely the most blessed and
fortunate of my life, and my adopted country shall never
have cause to regret giving it me.&rdquo; Deep in his heart
Paul Jones had a strange feeling that glory awaited him;
for those destined to immortality have mysterious foreknowledge
of it.</p>
<p>Occupied with these thoughts, Paul Jones did not
come out of his daydream until the boat&rsquo;s nose touched
the accommodation ladder over the Alfred&rsquo;s side. He
rose with a start, and held out a piece of money to the
boy, who blushed, and shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want no money,&rdquo; he said diffidently, &ldquo;for
helpin&rsquo; my country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Paul Jones paused and looked steadily at the ragged
lad, who looked back steadfastly at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seem to be rather an odd sort of boy&mdash;and, by my
life, I like such boys,&rdquo; said he. The quartermaster had
then come down the ladder, and stood ready to salute as
soon as he caught the young lieutenant&rsquo;s eye. This man,
Bill Green, was a remarkably handsome, bluff sailor of
about forty-five, with a fine figure, and was dressed with
as much care and neatness as if he were a quarter-deck
officer. Paul Jones was instantly struck by his admirable
appearance, and more so when he spoke. His voice was
full and musical, and his manner extremely polite and
respectful, without being in the least cringing. The lad,
too, seemed taken by the quartermaster&rsquo;s pleasant looks,
and spoke again, after a moment, looking alternately from
him to Paul Jones:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">4</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a very strong boy&mdash;and I allus thought I&rsquo;d like
to be a sailor. Won&rsquo;t you take me now, sir, and let me
fight the British?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The quartermaster grinned broadly at this, but Paul
Jones did not smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is your name, my lad?&mdash;and have you parents?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My name&rsquo;s Danny Dixon, sir, and I ain&rsquo;t got any
father or mother or brothers or sisters; and I&rsquo;d ruther be
a sailor, sir, nor anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Paul Jones looked hard at the boy, and then turned to
the quartermaster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see if his story is true, and if it is&mdash;why, we
shall have use for powder boys on this ship, and we
might do worse than take this lad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In course, sir,&rdquo; responded Green. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll find out
something about him, and I&rsquo;m thinkin&rsquo; he&rsquo;d make a good,
strong powder monkey and maybe he&rsquo;s old enough to be
helper to the jack-o&rsquo;-the-dust.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Danny&rsquo;s eyes gleamed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go ashore now, sir, and bring you back some one
to prove who I am,&rdquo; he cried eagerly; and Paul Jones
had to step hurriedly out of the boat to keep from being
carried back to the dock, so keen was the boy to put off.
And in two hours he was back again on the Alfred, and
regularly entered on the ship&rsquo;s books.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; said Bill Green, who was a foks&rsquo;l wag,
&ldquo;when we comes to fightin&rsquo; the British, most likely the
cap&rsquo;n will call you up and make you a quarter gunner, or
sumpin&rsquo; on the spot, boy; and you can&rsquo;t git your share of
the prize money if you ain&rsquo;t entered on the ship&rsquo;s books,
reg&rsquo;lar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Danny luckily did not mention his expectation of
becoming a quarter gunner to Paul Jones, who, as first
lieutenant, had charge of the ship in the absence of her
captain. But he did ask that he might be put on the
books so he could get his prize money; which the young
lieutenant promised to do, laughing in spite of himself
at Danny&rsquo;s serious expectation of a considerable fortune
in prize money.</p>
<p>Captain Saltonstall was to command the Alfred, but
he had not yet arrived, and upon Paul Jones rested
the duty of preparing the ship for sea. From the day
his foot first touched the deck his active spirit pervaded
everything, and the officers under him, as well as the
men, felt the force of his commanding energy. Besides
working all day, he and the other officers stood watch
and watch on deck throughout the wintry nights, to
prevent desertions; and although every other ship in
the squadron had her crew lessened by desertion, not a
single man was lost from the Alfred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m a-thinkin&rsquo;, mates,&rdquo; remarked Bill Green, in
the confidence of the foks&rsquo;l, &ldquo;as how we&rsquo;ve got a
leftenant as is a seaman; I seen it by the cut o&rsquo; his jib;
and if he was the cap&rsquo;n o&rsquo; this &rsquo;ere ship, he&rsquo;d lock yardarms
with a Britisher if he had half a chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One day, in the midst of the bustle of fitting the ship
out, Commodore Hopkins, who was to command the little
squadron, came on board the Alfred. He was formally
received at the gangway by Paul Jones and shown over
the ship by him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p>The commodore was a big, burly man, who had spent
the best part of his life at sea. He examined the ship
carefully, and his silence, as Paul Jones explained what he
had done and was doing with the means at his command,
made the young lieutenant fear that it had not met with
the commodore&rsquo;s approval. But, secure in the consciousness
that he had done his duty, Paul Jones could afford to
do without the praise of his superiors. He was not,
however, destined to this mortification. Standing on the
quarter-deck, surrounded by the officers, Commodore
Hopkins turned to Paul Jones, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your activity has pleased me extremely, and my
confidence in you is such, that if Captain Saltonstall
should be unable to reach here by the time the ships can
get away, I shall hoist my flag on this ship, and give you
the command of her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A flush rose in Paul Jones&rsquo;s dark face, and he bowed
with the graceful courtesy that always distinguished
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, commodore,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and may I be
pardoned for hoping that Captain Saltonstall may not
arrive in time? And when your flag is hoisted on the
Alfred, there will be, I trust, a flag of the United Colonies
to fly at the peak, and I aspire to be the first man to raise
that flag upon the ocean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Commodore Hopkins smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the Congress is as slow as I expect it to be, it will
be some time yet in adopting a flag; and there will not be
time to have one made for the ship before we sail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think there will, sir,&rdquo; replied Paul Jones.</p>
<p>The young lieutenant had good reason for his expectation.
The Congress had practically decided upon the
flag, and Paul Jones, out of his own pocket, had bought
the materials to make one. Bill Green was an expert
with the needle, boasting that he could &ldquo;hand, reef, and
steer a needle like the best o&rsquo; them tailor men,&rdquo; and was
fully capable of making a flag.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<p>On a stormy February day, when the channel had
been freed from ice enough for the little squadron to get
out, the Alfred was made ready to receive her flag officer.
Captain Saltonstall had arrived some days before, to Paul
Jones&rsquo;s intense disappointment. But he was as ready to
do his duty as first lieutenant as he had been that hoped-for
duty as acting captain.</p>
<p>The commodore&rsquo;s boat was seen approaching on the
wind tossed water. The horizon was overcast, and dun
clouds scurried wildly across the troubled sky, with which
the pale and wintry sun struggled vainly. The boatswain&rsquo;s
call, &ldquo;All hands to muster!&rdquo; sounded through the
ship, and in a wonderfully short time, owing to the careful
drilling of Paul Jones, the three hundred men and one
hundred marines were drawn up on deck. The sailors, a
fine-looking body of American seamen, were formed in
ranks on the port side of the quarter-deck, while abaft of
them stood the marine guard, under arms. On the starboard
side were the petty officers, and on the quarter-deck
proper were the commissioned officers in full uniform
with their swords, and Paul Jones headed the line.</p>
<p>When it was reported, &ldquo;All hands up and aft!&rdquo; Captain
Saltonstall appeared out of the cabin. Paul Jones, having
previously arranged it, called out, &ldquo;Quartermaster!&rdquo; and
Bill Green, neat, handsome and sailorlike, stepped from
the ranks of the petty officers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p>From some unknown regions about his clothes Bill
produced a flag, rolled up, and, following Paul Jones,
stepped briskly aft to the flagstaff. He affixed the flag to
the halyards, along with the broad pennant of a commodore,
saw that they worked properly, and then stood by.
The commodore&rsquo;s boat was then at the ladder, and the
commodore came over the side. Just as his foot touched
the quarter-deck the flag with the pennant flew up on the
staff like magic, under Paul Jones&rsquo;s hands, the breeze
caught it and flung it wide to the free air, and the sun,
suddenly bursting out, bathed it in glory. Every officer,
from the commodore down, instantly removed his cap,
the drummer boys beat a double ruffle on the drums, and
a tremendous cheer burst from the sailors and marines.
As Paul Jones advanced, Commodore Hopkins said to
him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I congratulate you upon your enterprise. The flag
was only adopted in Congress yesterday, and this one is
the very first to fly.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Such was my hope, sir,&rdquo; answered Paul Jones, modestly.
&ldquo;I wished the honor of hoisting the flag of freedom
the first time it was ever displayed; and this man,&rdquo; pointing
to Bill Green, who stood smiling behind him, &ldquo;sat up
all last night in order to make this ensign for the ship&mdash;an
ensign which will ever be attended with veneration upon
the ocean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill Green came in for his share of congratulation
too; and as if the appearance of the flag had bewitched
the wind, it suddenly shifted to fair, the sun came out
brilliantly, and within half an hour the squadron of five
ships&mdash;the Columbus, the Andrew Doria, the Sebastian
Cabot, and the Providence, led by the Alfred&mdash;had spread
all their canvas, and were winging swiftly toward the free
and open sea.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER II.</span></h2>
<p>The first enterprise determined upon was an expedition
to the island of New Providence, in the West Indies. On
the 17th of February the squadron had set sail from the
Delaware, and on the morning of the 1st of March it
appeared off the harbor of New Providence. There were
two forts to protect the town, but at that moment there
was not a soldier on the island. When the American
squadron was sighted, though, an alarm gun was fired,
and the inhabitants manned the forts and turned the guns
on the American vessels just outside the bar. The little
American squadron carried only two hundred marines,
and it was determined to land them under the fire of the
ships; but owing to the bar at the mouth of the harbor
the Alfred and the Columbus could not pass in; only the
smaller vessels could get in with any prospect of coming
out at low tide. From the lack of charts, the Americans
had to take great risks in finding safe anchorages.
But the pilot taken on board the Alfred declared that he
knew of an anchorage, under a key three leagues to windward
of the harbor, where the larger vessels might safely
await the result of the attack on the town. This news
was carried to Commodore Hopkins as he restlessly
paced the Alfred&rsquo;s deck, looking at the white-walled
town lying before him in the warm March sunshine.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>&ldquo;But, Mr. Jones,&rdquo; said he to Paul Jones, who had
brought the pilot aboard, &ldquo;how can we answer for the
faithfulness of these pilots? They may cheerfully take
the risk of being lost along with us rather than put us
in a position to take the town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite true, sir,&rdquo; answered Paul Jones, &ldquo;but if you
will give me leave, I will undertake, with this pilot, to
carry the ship to a safe anchorage, and I will answer for
it with my commission if I do not take her safely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, then,&rdquo; replied the commodore; &ldquo;if you
will assume the responsibility, I will trust the ship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It had then fallen dead calm, and all through the long
spring day they waited for a puff of wind. The short
twilight of the tropics was upon them before the wind
sprang up again. At the first breeze the Alfred set every
sail that would draw, and, followed by the Columbus,
headed for the key. The sky was a deep rose-red in the
west, and overhead of a pale and luminous green. The
full moon was rising, round and yellow, over the town,
and a few solitary stars twinkled in the vast expanse of
the sky. Paul Jones, followed by the pilot, went aloft to
the foretopmast head, where a clear view of everything
was to be had. In the deep and breathless silence every
occasional sound could be heard, and scarcely a word was
uttered except the orders, as the ship ran down the chain
of islands, with a fair wind, in the moonlit night. Bill
Green was at the wheel, while three or four officers,
stationed at various points along the deck, repeated the
orders called out in Paul Jones&rsquo;s clear and penetrating
voice, so that no mistake might be made. A man on the
port side and another on the starboard kept the lead
going constantly. Commodore Hopkins and Captain
Saltonstall paced the deck together.</p>
<p>At intervals Paul Jones&rsquo;s voice would be heard calling
out:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>&ldquo;Port a little&mdash;hard aport&mdash;steady!&rdquo; While the man
with the lead on the starboard side would sing musically,
in the peculiar cadence used in sounding:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a quarter&mdash;less&mdash;six.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This meant they were in five and three quarter fathoms&mdash;plenty
of water for the ship. The sailor sounding
on the port side would sing in the same key:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a quarter&mdash;less&mdash;six.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Paul Jones, with every nerve strained, listened to the
soundings, the sweet call ringing softly in the half darkness
as the ship glided through the purple night. Sometimes
she was in the full light of the moon, and then a
shadow would descend upon the sea, and she would slip
through it like a phantom ship. Two cables&rsquo; length off,
the Columbus followed in her wake. Once the man
sang out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a quarter&mdash;past&mdash;<i>three</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Every soul on board gave a gasp&mdash;the water was
getting shoal; and Paul Jones shouted quickly from the
fore-topmast, &ldquo;Starboard&mdash;starboard your helm!&rdquo; The
next sounding was four and a half fathoms, and at last,
just as the moon emerged in splendor from a thin white
cloud, the Alfred rounded the key, and the cable rattled
out noisily as the anchor was dropped in six fathoms of
water. Paul Jones felt as if a hand clutching his heart
had been suddenly loosed. He had piloted the ship
safely, and had anchored her; his commission was safe;
and he was from that moment the best known junior
officer in the squadron.</p>
<p>Next morning the marines were landed, a large quantity
of arms and stores were captured and embarked, and
the squadron set sail for home.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER III.</span></h2>
<p>The morning of the 9th of April dawned clear and
lovely. The American squadron, on its return from New
Providence, was making its way cautiously along the
New England coast, and although every part of it was
swarming with British vessels, it was determined to take
the squadron into Long Island Sound by the way of Narragansett
Bay.</p>
<p>Paul Jones went about his arduous duties as first lieutenant
with his usual steady determination, but at heart
he cherished a secret dissatisfaction. His bold and enterprising
spirit was not adapted to submission. He could
obey, but his destiny was to command. Commodore
Hopkins was a brave man, but he was not above the
average in either enterprise or intelligence. Several
strategic mistakes that he made during the affair at New
Providence had not escaped the searching eye of Paul
Jones, and he felt a dread of encountering the British
then, for fear that the American commodore would not
be equal to so great an occasion. He knew that they
would have to run the gauntlet of Commodore Wallace&rsquo;s
fleet off Newport, and his brave heart trembled at the
idea that all of glory possible would not be reaped.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>The day passed, though, without any adventures.
Numerous white sails were seen, but the squadron, sailing
well together, was not molested. Although not disposed
to decline a fight, the value of the arms and ammunition
on board to the Continental army made Commodore
Hopkins quite willing to &ldquo;let sleeping dogs lie.&rdquo; But
this was contrary to the temperament of Paul Jones.
He realized instinctively his capacity for meeting extraordinary
dangers with extraordinary resources of mind
and courage, and he could not but despise the risks that
other men shunned.</p>
<p>Toward night they entered the blue waters of Narragansett
Bay. A young moon hung trembling in the
heavens, the sky was cloudless, and the stars shone brilliantly.</p>
<p>Although Paul Jones, being first lieutenant, had no
watch on deck, he remained above. About midnight
the lookout on the quarter made out Block Island, and
almost at the same moment a cry was heard from the
Cabot, known as &ldquo;the black brig,&rdquo; of &ldquo;Sail, ho!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think it is, Mr. Jones?&rdquo; asked Commodore
Hopkins, with night glass in hand, examining the
shadowy form of a ship under light canvas about half a
mile off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it is a British frigate, sir,&rdquo; replied Paul Jones,
after looking intently at her. &ldquo;She is too small for a ship
of the line, and she does not carry sail enough for a merchant
vessel with a good wind. She is simply cruising
about, and probably looking for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Cabot being in the lead, night signals were made
to her to engage the attention of the stranger, which had
tacked, and was now making straight for the American
squadron. Paul Jones then, as first lieutenant, saw the
captain&rsquo;s orders carried out to clear the Alfred for action
as quietly as possible. No drums were beat, and the men
went silently to their quarters. The batteries were lighted
up, but by keeping the ports closed as little was shown as
possible. A string of battle lanterns was laid in a row on
the gun deck by little Danny Dixon, who wagged his head
knowingly at Bill Green, who happened to be passing,
and remarked:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>&ldquo;I say, Mr. Green, there will be some prize money for
we arter this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, there won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; answered Bill, gruffly. &ldquo;This &rsquo;ere
commodore, he ain&rsquo;t got a very good appetite for fightin&rsquo;.
Now, if Mr. Jones was commandin&rsquo;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just as the words were out of his mouth the quartermaster
turned suddenly and saw Paul Jones&rsquo;s stern eyes
fixed on him. The first lieutenant, on making his last
round, had come unexpectedly upon Bill, who knew better
than to express such opinions about the commodore.</p>
<p>A dead silence followed. Paul Jones did not speak,
but the look in his eye commanded discretion to Bill, who
immediately began fumbling about the lanterns and
instructing Danny in his duty.</p>
<p>The incident, though, made a deep impression upon
Paul Jones. &ldquo;If that is the feeling among the men, there
is little hope of capturing the British ship,&rdquo; he thought
bitterly to himself.</p>
<p>He then went above, and just as his foot touched the
deck he heard the frigate, which was now close upon
them, hail the black brig.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you, and where are you bound?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The black brig answered: &ldquo;This is the Betsy, from
Plymouth. Who are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Every ear was strained to catch the answer. It came
ringing over the smooth water:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is His Majesty&rsquo;s ship Glasgow, of twenty-four
guns.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>It was now about half past two o&rsquo;clock in the morning.
The moon had gone down, and in the darkness the Glasgow
evidently was ignorant of the character of the five
vessels strung out together. The Cabot had now got
very close on the lee bow of the Glasgow, and suddenly
poured a broadside into her. Instantly the British ship
seemed to wake up to her danger. She bore up and ran
off to clear for action, but within a quarter of an hour she
came up gallantly to engage the whole American squadron.</p>
<p>Paul Jones was in command of the gun deck. The
Alfred was so heavily laden that she was down in the
water almost to her portsills; the sea, however, being
smooth, he was enabled to work his batteries whenever
the man&oelig;uvres of the ship made it possible. The two
ships finally got into such a position that they kept up a
furious cannonade until daybreak. The Glasgow was
hulled a number of times, her mainmast was crippled, and
her sails and rigging almost destroyed; she had fifty-two
shot through her mizzen staysail, one hundred and ten
through her mainsail, and eighty-eight through her foresail,
besides having her royal yards carried away. But
she had disabled the Cabot at the second broadside, and
then, concentrating her fire on the Alfred, the wheel
block and ropes of the American ship were carried away,
and she came up into the wind, giving the Glasgow a
chance to pour in several raking broadsides before the
ship could be brought on the wind again. Daylight
coming, the Glasgow made signals to the rest of the
British fleet, then plainly in sight, and the American
drew off.</p>
<p>The action might be considered a draw, taking into
account the damage done the British ship, and that she
evidently had had enough of it. To the impetuous soul
of Paul Jones though it seemed from the first to be what
he afterward pronounced it&mdash;&ldquo;the disgraceful affair with
the Glasgow.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>From that hour there was no longer any confidence
possible between him and Commodore Hopkins. The
commodore had acted according to his best judgment;
but he was not a Paul Jones. As Bill Green expressed it
in the foks&rsquo;l: &ldquo;When the Glasgow went off howlin&rsquo; like
a broken-legged dog, there oughter been somebody to
stop her; and, mates, if Mr. Paul Jones had &rsquo;a&rsquo; been in
command, we&rsquo;d &rsquo;a&rsquo; had some prize money sure, as well as
savin&rsquo; our credit.&rdquo; Although there was a subtile estrangement
between Commodore Hopkins and Paul Jones, each
respected the other&rsquo;s character. But it was more agreeable
to the commodore to have Paul Jones anywhere than
on the Alfred, so that in a very short while he was
placed in command of the sloop of war Providence.</p>
<p>In manning the sloop, Commodore Hopkins gave Paul
Jones the privilege of taking his petty officers from the
crew of the Alfred. As soon as this was known Bill
Green begged hard to be of the number, and so he was
permitted to go.</p>
<p>In the bustle and excitement of the change Paul Jones
had quite forgotten Danny Dixon. While making his
final preparations in his cabin to change his quarters to
the Providence, Danny appeared at the door with his best
clothes on and a bundle in his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, Danny?&rdquo; asked Paul Jones kindly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothin&rsquo;, sir,&rdquo; answered Danny, &ldquo;&rsquo;cep&rsquo; I&rsquo;m ready to
go, sir, whenever you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; said Paul Jones, looking
closely at the boy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, sir, ain&rsquo;t I a-goin&rsquo; with you on the Providence?&rdquo;
replied Danny, in a surprised voice. &ldquo;When I heard you
had done got your orders, I went and made up my kit.
Mr. Green, the quartermaster, come along, sir, and he
says you axed for him to go with you, and that you had
said you was goin&rsquo; to make me a boatswain&rsquo;s mate, and
for me to git my kit. I wanted to go with you anyhow,
sir, though I didn&rsquo;t expect to be nothin&rsquo; but a ship&rsquo;s boy;
but when you axed for me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy&rsquo;s simplicity was so genuine that Paul Jones
could not laugh at him. He only said, smiling a little:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well. Green is to be my quartermaster, and
I&rsquo;ll see the captain, and perhaps he may let me have you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thankee, sir,&rdquo; replied Danny gratefully, and sitting
down outside the cabin door he kept his earnest eyes fixed
on Paul Jones, like a dog on his master. Presently Paul
Jones came out, and after a few words with the captain,
Danny was told that he might go along with the new
commander of the Providence. Paul Jones was touched
by the boy&rsquo;s devotion, and took him for the captain&rsquo;s
cabin boy.</p>
<p>Paul Jones had good reason to be satisfied with all the
people he had brought from the Alfred. Bill Green,
besides being a first-class quartermaster, was such a pleasant,
cheery, waggish fellow that he kept everything forward
in a good humor. Moreover, he had a very valuable
talent&mdash;he could sing beautifully, and had a store of
sea songs, some of which he had picked up in the British
navy, where he had served some time, and others were
patriotic songs which were often composed and much
sung in those days. But Bill had a weakness&mdash;he always
professed to have composed all his songs himself, and to
have written them out, when it was a well-known fact that
he could not write a word. He had signed the ship&rsquo;s
books with a cross instead of his name, which he explained
by saying: &ldquo;The officer, he was in a hurry, and it was
gittin&rsquo; on toward my watch, and I didn&rsquo;t have no half
hour to spend writin&rsquo; &lsquo;Bill Green,&rsquo; so I jest made a cross
mark, not thinkin&rsquo; as how nobody would suspicion I
couldn&rsquo;t write; and then, it takes so much o&rsquo; my time to
write my songs, I ain&rsquo;t got none for to write my name.&rdquo;
All this was received with many sly winks by the men, but
they were willing to humor the handsome quartermaster
in anything, he was such a favorite with them. Bill, also,
like other artists, liked to be urged. This, too, was fully
understood, and he always yielded to pressure.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>The Providence was a good sailer, but she carried
only twelve small guns and seventy men. She was employed
in transporting men and stores along the shores at
the eastern entrance of Long Island Sound, and as this
was done in the face of overwhelming British fleets, the
address and seamanship of young Captain Jones was fully
proved. So great was his success in eluding the British,
that the Cerberus frigate made it an especial object to
capture the little sloop. She got the Providence under
her guns several times, but the sloop always managed to
edge away. Once, while the Providence was convoying
a brig loaded with military supplies for General Washington,
the Cerberus caught sight of her and crowded on
sail to overhaul her. Captain Jones signaled to the brig
to get out of the way as fast as possible, while he man&oelig;uvred
with studied awkwardness in sight of the Cerberus.
On came the powerful frigate to crush the little sloop,
but as soon as Paul Jones saw the brig safe, he made for
shoal water, where the frigate dared not follow him, and
escaped as night came on.</p>
<p>Early in August he was regularly commissioned as
captain, and sailed for the Bermudas, on his first independent
cruise. By that time the officers and men under
him had come to know what manner of man he was, and
looked forward to a glorious cruise with him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>It was characteristic of Paul Jones to make the best of
all his opportunities, and he managed out of a feeble sloop
to make an efficient and fast-sailing cruiser. He trimmed
the ship so that she sailed well both on and off the wind,
and he was thus in condition either to fight or run away,
whichever he chose.</p>
<p>The officers and men were in fine spirits, and the very
first evening out, as they sailed along with a spanking
breeze, Bill Green piped up an inspiring song to his mates
on the foks&rsquo;l, which echoed even to the quarter-deck.
The officers listened with pleasure, while Bill sung in his
full, round, and musical baritone the following song:<a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a></p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;When the anchor&rsquo;s weighed and the ship&rsquo;s unmoored,</p>

<p>A loud chorus of cheers greeted the song, and Bill
retired, covered with glory and embarrassment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER IV.</span></h2>
<p>It was on the first day of September that the Providence
sighted a large ship, which was mistaken for an Indiaman,
homeward bound. She proved to be the Solebay,
frigate, with twenty guns mounted on one deck. On
seeing the Providence, the Solebay made for her, and the
sloop had to take to her heels. But the Solebay proved
to be a magnificent sailer on the wind, and the Providence
had evidently more than her match in speed. The Providence,
small as she was, had cleared for action, for, as
Paul Jones declared, &ldquo;I will give her one round, if I go
to the bottom for it.&rdquo; The men highly approved of this
sentiment, and the little four-pounders were run out to
salute the flag the Providence carried&mdash;because her fire
was little more than a salute.</p>
<p>The day was warm and clear, and the breeze fresh.
The little Providence was legging it briskly over the
water, but the Solebay gained upon her every hour.
The chase had begun about noon, and by four o&rsquo;clock
the frigate was within pistol shot. Paul Jones was on the
horse block of his little vessel, and Bill Green was at the
wheel. Danny Dixon had gravely prepared for action
upon the sly hints given by his friend and patron, Bill.
The boy had stripped to the waist, and, wrapping a handkerchief
about his head, instead of his hat, was all ready
to take his place at the head of the line of powder boys.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>As the frigate gained more and more on the little
Providence, every heart sank except that of the dauntless
captain. Paul Jones, however, remained calm, and even
confident.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;their guns in broadside are fast.
They think they can take us by firing a bow chaser, but
they are mistaken. What would be easier than to bear
away before the wind under their broadside?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Providence had all her light canvas set, and was
flying like a bird from her pursuer; but the pursuer was
nevertheless perceptibly gaining.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will show our ensign as well as give her a volley,&rdquo;
cried Paul Jones gayly, and the next moment the American
colors fluttered out.</p>
<p>To their surprise, the Solebay now hoisted American
colors too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lying, lying,&rdquo; said Paul Jones, turning to his officers.
&ldquo;Would that we had such a vessel in our little navy!
She is British, depend upon it. Her lines tell it too
plainly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Solebay though imagining that she was weathering
on the chase and sure to capture the saucy American,
soon hauled down her American colors and ran up the
Union Jack.</p>
<p>The officers saw by the light in Paul Jones&rsquo;s eyes that
he still had a trump card to play. All this time he was
walking the quarter-deck with his light and springy step,
his face wearing a smile. Presently he called out himself
to Bill Green, at the wheel:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give her a good full, quartermaster.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A good full, sir,&rdquo; replied Bill in a sailor&rsquo;s musical
singsong.</p>
<p>Paul Jones then ordered the square sails and then the
studding sails set.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic2">
<img src="images/p_033.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="808" />
<p class="caption">&ldquo;<i>Hooray for Cap&rsquo;n Paul Jones!</i>&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>The next moment the helm was put up, and before
the astonished people on the Solebay knew what was
happening, the American sloop of war ran directly under
her enemy&rsquo;s broadside and went off dead before the wind.
The keen eyes of Paul Jones had noticed that in the
Solebay&rsquo;s fancied certainty of capturing the American
she had not even cast loose and manned her batteries in
broadside, thinking a shot or two from her bow guns
would bring the Providence to when she was overhauled.
But the Providence had a captain the like of
which the Solebay had never met before, and he could
dare and do unlooked-for things.</p>
<p>In vain the frigate came about in haste and confusion.
Her prey was gone, and the Americans were cheering
and jeering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boy,&rdquo; said Bill Green in a hoarse whisper to Danny
Dixon, who was passing near him: &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do no cheerin&rsquo;
at the wheel, so you cheer for me; and if you don&rsquo;t
pipe up as loud as the best of &rsquo;em I&rsquo;ll tan your hide for
you the wust you ever see, jest as soon as my relief
comes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Danny was disposed to cheer anyhow, but Bill
Green&rsquo;s promise of a licking in case he did not do his full
duty in the matter, tended to encourage him. He took
his stand by the foremast and a series of diabolical
whoops and yells resounded. &ldquo;Hooray!&rdquo; bawled Danny.
&ldquo;Hooray for Cap&rsquo;n Paul Jones! Hooray for the Providence!
Hooray for Mr. Bill Green! Hooray for the
powder monkeys on this &rsquo;ere ship!&rdquo; and so on indefinitely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is that youngster yelling?&rdquo; asked Paul Jones,
laughing at the gravity and persistence with which Danny
kept up his performance.</p>
<p>One of the officers went up to him, and returned
laughing too:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>&ldquo;He says, sir, that Green, the quartermaster, told him
to hurrah, and if he doesn&rsquo;t keep it up he is afraid Green
will give him the cat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everybody laughed, and they agreed the best plan
was to let Danny and the quartermaster settle it between
them. Danny hurrahed for a solid half hour, until Green&rsquo;s
relief came. The old sailor then went up to him, grinning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can shet that potato-trap o&rsquo; yourn now,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll take a turn myself,&rdquo; whereupon Bill, inflating
his lungs, roared out solemnly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three cheers for Cap&rsquo;n Paul Jones!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hooray! hooray! hooray!&rdquo; piped Danny Dixon&rsquo;s
shrill treble.</p>
<p>Paul Jones&rsquo;s daring exploit still further increased the
respect that his officers and men felt, and they showed it
in a hundred ways.</p>
<p>Three weeks now passed, and the Providence steered
to the northern seas. One day, off Cape Sable, in Nova
Scotia, the weather being brilliantly clear, Bill Green and
others of the men asked permission to catch for their mess
some of the fish that abounded. As they had been on
salt provisions for a long time, Paul Jones readily gave
the desired permission, and the ship was hove to. A
sharp lookout was kept, however, but nothing occurred
to disturb the men in their amusement, until toward afternoon,
when a sail was made out to windward of them.
Instantly the fishing came to a stop, and the Providence,
setting some of her light sails, waited for the stranger on
an easy bowline.</p>
<p>As the ship approached, Paul Jones plainly saw that
she was no such sailer as the Solebay, and thought he
could amuse himself with her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That vessel, I take it,&rdquo; he remarked to his first lieutenant,
&ldquo;is the Milford frigate. I have expected to fall
in with her, and we can outfoot her, that is clear.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>The Milford, however, began to chase. When she
got within cannon shot Paul Jones doubled on her
quarter; when, seeing he had the advantage of her in
speed, he began to lead her a wild-goose chase. For
eight hours the pursuit continued, the Providence keeping
just out of range of the cannonade which the Milford
kept up unceasingly, wasting in it enormous quantities of
powder and shot. Paul Jones was much too astute to
throw away any of his ammunition in a perfectly useless
cannonade, but as he said, &ldquo;I can not be so rude as to
receive a salute without returning it.&rdquo; Turning to his
marine officer, he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Direct one of your men to load his musket, and as
often as the Milford salutes our flag with her great guns,
we will reply with a musket shot at least.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The officer, smiling, went after his man, and stationed
him on the quarter-deck. The next time the slow-sailing
frigate thundered out a tremendous volley, the marine,
with his musket at his shoulder, stood ready for the word.
The officer called out, &ldquo;Fire!&rdquo; and the marine banged
away at the frigate amid the uproarious laughter and
cheering of the American sailors. This was kept up for
an hour or two, when, a good breeze springing up, the
Providence set all her canvas and ran off, leaving the Milford
completely in the lurch.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>They had another brush with the Milford before the
cruise was up. Captain Jones had captured a fine ship,
the Mellish, loaded with clothing, which was badly
needed by the army of Washington. While convoying
her, and with his ship filled with prisoners taken from
other prizes, he ran across the Milford. The frigate immediately
gave chase. As it was night, Captain Jones
set lights at his topmast, and everywhere a light could
be put, while the Mellish, with her valuable cargo, carried
no lights at all, and slipped off in the darkness.
When day broke, Captain Jones found that the Mellish
was not in sight, while the Milford was crowding on sail
to overhaul him. But the little Providence again showed
a clean pair of heels, and some days afterward the Mellish
was brought in, to the great rejoicing of the patriotic
army.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER V.</span></h2>
<p>The repute of Paul Jones was now great, and the
American Congress intended sending him abroad to take
command of a splendid frigate, then building in Holland.
But owing to the representations of the British Government
to Holland, and also to France, which had not then
openly joined the American cause, the frigate was handed
over to the French Government instead of to the American
commissioners at Paris. These commissioners were
Benjamin Franklin, Silas Deane, and Arthur Lee. The
next best thing to be done for Captain Jones was to give
him command of the Ranger, sloop of war. She was then
fitting out at Portsmouth, New Hampshire.</p>
<p>The Congress had adopted, on the 14th of July, 1777,
the present national ensign of the stars and stripes, and
on the same day Paul Jones received his orders to command
the Ranger. He at once started for Portsmouth,
carrying with him one of the new flags, and as he had before
hoisted for the first time the original flag of the colonies,
so he had the honor of raising the new ensign upon
the Ranger the first time the Stars and Stripes ever floated
over an American man-of-war.</p>
<p>There never was any trouble about manning Paul
Jones&rsquo;s ships, and neither Bill Green nor little Danny
Dixon could have been kept off with a stick. Therefore,
on the fair, bright summer day that Paul Jones arrived at
Portsmouth the very first creature he put his eyes on
was Danny.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, how are you, my lad?&rdquo; cried Paul Jones, as he
sprang out of the lumbering stagecoach, and saw Danny
standing by the door of the inn where it stopped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite well, sir,&rdquo; answered Danny with shining eyes,
and stepping up to take Paul Jones&rsquo;s luggage. He shouldered
two portmanteaus manfully, but Paul Jones held on
to a large parcel that he carried under his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;this is too precious to be trusted
out of my own hand. And how did you know I would
be here to-day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know it for certain, sir, but Mr. Green and
me, we has stood watch and watch for two days lookin&rsquo;
for you, and Mr. Green says, if he ain&rsquo;t the fust man
aboard the Ranger to know you has come as how he&rsquo;ll
take it out on my hide, certain. But that&rsquo;s only Mr.
Green&rsquo;s way o&rsquo; jokin&rsquo;, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Danny went through with this very respectfully, and
Paul Jones&rsquo;s smiling eyes showed that he knew perfectly
well the relations between the devoted little cabin boy,
and the sturdy quartermaster. &ldquo;Come on, then,&rdquo; cried he,
&ldquo;and I have something here to decorate my ship with,
that will make her shine indeed.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>In a little while they reached the ship, Danny red
and proud with the honor of carrying the captain&rsquo;s luggage.
Sure enough, there stood Bill Green at the gangway,
and he took his hat off as soon as he caught sight
of Paul Jones. For his part, Paul Jones was delighted
to know that he could count upon such a reliable petty
officer as Bill, and greeted him warmly. Bill immediately
snatched the luggage from Danny, who was left
disconsolate, without even the Captain&rsquo;s portmanteau to
comfort him. The first lieutenant was on deck, and as
soon as Paul Jones had greeted his officers he went aft,
and, unrolling his parcel, shook out a large and handsome
silk flag, the &ldquo;Uncle Sam&rsquo;s gridiron,&rdquo; which he was destined,
as he himself expressed it, &ldquo;to attend with veneration
on the ocean.&rdquo; Bill Green fastened the flag to the halyards,
but Paul Jones himself drew it up to the peak,
amid the cheers of officers and men. Thus had he hoisted
with his own hands the Stars and Stripes for the first time
on an American ship of war, as he had been the first man
to hoist the original flag of freedom.</p>
<p>From the day he stepped on board the Ranger, matters
went on as they only can under the direction of a perfect
sailor. The officers were enthusiastic and the crew
made up of excellent material. Bill Green had long ago
proved himself a very valuable man. He continued, however,
to harass Danny Dixon with foks&rsquo;l wit. But Danny
had discovered that Bill&rsquo;s magnificent promises of promotion
and assurances of Captain Jones&rsquo;s favor, were
merely &ldquo;pullin&rsquo; a leg,&rdquo; in sailor language. Danny was
now a tall, stout boy of fourteen, and very active aloft.
Therefore, a day or two after Paul Jones got on board he
said to the boy:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dixon, I think you can be classed as a seaman apprentice,
and thereby raise your rating.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d ruther wait on you, sir,&rdquo; promptly answered
Danny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But your share of prize money would be larger if you
were rated as a seaman apprentice, instead of merely a
ship&rsquo;s boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d ruther wait on you, sir&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then you&rsquo;d stand a chance of being rated as an
able seaman in two or three years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d ruther wait on you, sir,&rdquo; doggedly answered
Danny.</p>
<p>Paul Jones smiled, and said no more.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>This all occurred in July, but it was not until November
that the ship was ready to sail. She was by that time
well manned, but owing to the poverty and lack of resource
of the struggling Government she was poorly
equipped. She had only one suit of sails, and those very
indifferent, and not a single spare sail in case any mishap
should befall her canvas in a wintry passage across the
stormy Atlantic. There was likewise another deficiency,
which gave the men much disquietude, especially Bill
Green&mdash;there was only a single barrel of rum on board.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you what it is, youngster,&rdquo; said Bill solemnly to
Danny, it being a favorite amusement of his to tell the
most grewsome yarns he could invent to the boy, &ldquo;this
&rsquo;ere&rsquo;s a ornlucky ship&mdash;mark my words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Mr. Green,&rdquo; answered Danny earnestly, &ldquo;ain&rsquo;t
Cap&rsquo;n Paul Jones commandin&rsquo; of her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;W&rsquo;y, yes, boy, but you know there&rsquo;s lucky ships and
ornlucky ships. There ain&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo; goin&rsquo; to happen to <i>we</i>&mdash;&rsquo;cause
Cap&rsquo;n Paul Jones is commandin&rsquo;, as you say&mdash;but
we ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to git no prize money to speak of. Likely
as not, we won&rsquo;t capture nothin&rsquo; wuth havin&rsquo;. We ain&rsquo;t
got but one barrel o&rsquo; rum aboard, and that&rsquo;s the ornluckiest
thing that ever was. It&rsquo;s worse nor a black cat aboard
ship. I&rsquo;d ruther have ten black cats and sail on a Friday,
and meet all the pirates afloat, than to start on a short
&rsquo;lowance o&rsquo; rum. It&rsquo;s dreadful ornlucky, boy, and it&rsquo;s
dreadful tryin&rsquo; besides.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Danny fully believed him, as Bill, with a huge sigh,
cut a quid of tobacco and began to chew dolefully.</p>
<p>Bill&rsquo;s prediction was carried out to the letter, for from
the cheerless day the Ranger sailed out of Portsmouth
harbor until she made the coast of France no prize was
taken.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>This was partly due to Captain Jones&rsquo;s desire to get
to the other side as quickly as possible. The weather
was rough and the Ranger proved very crank, and it was
not until the 2d of December that the port of Nantes was
made. The guns were covered up, the portlids lowered,
and everything as far as possible done to conceal the warlike
character of the ship.</p>
<p>Paul Jones immediately set out for Paris, and on the
third day he knocked at the door of a charming house at
Passy, one of the most beautiful suburbs of Paris. This
was a house belonging to M. Ray de Chaumont, a rich
French gentleman whose sympathies with the American
cause were so strong that he offered the American commissioners
the use of his house until they could make permanent
arrangements. Some instinct had told Paul Jones
that he should find a friend in Benjamin Franklin, then at
the zenith of his fame, and the most influential of the three
American commissioners at Paris. The first meeting of
these two great men, destined to be lifelong friends, was
an event in history. Without the confidence and support
of Franklin, Paul Jones would probably never had the
means of achieving greatness, and this support and confidence
never wavered from the moment these two immortal
men stood face to face and looked through their eyes into
each other&rsquo;s souls. Franklin&rsquo;s venerable figure and grave,
concentrated glance contrasted strongly with Paul Jones&rsquo;s
lithe and active form and the piercing expression of his
clear-cut features. The two men grasped hands and so
stood for a moment, each fascinated by something in the
aspect of the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Welcome to France,&rdquo; said Franklin. &ldquo;I have heard
of you, and every such man as you is a mighty help to our
cause.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>Paul Jones murmured some words expressive of the
admiration he felt for a man so truly eminent as Franklin,
but his bold spirit was abashed in the presence of so much
greatness in this patriarchal old man. They spent the
whole of the short winter day in converse, each more and
more dazzled and charmed by the other. At twilight
they said farewell at the open door. As they clasped
hands in parting, Paul Jones said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had the honor of hoisting the flag of our country
for the first time upon the ocean, and I intend to claim
for it all the honors that it deserves. As soon as I am in
the presence of the French fleet I shall demand a salute;
and I shall get it, mark my words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe <i>you</i>, if any man can, will get it,&rdquo; answered
Franklin. &ldquo;And remember&mdash;if we can not secure you a
ship worthy of you, and you are still compelled to keep
the Ranger, you shall at least have <i>carte blanche</i> for your
cruise, for I do not believe in hampering spirits so bold
and enterprising as yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Paul Jones walked away in the dusk of twilight he
glanced back and saw Franklin still standing in the doorway,
with the light from an overhead lantern falling on
his silvery hair. Paul Jones felt that the day of his meeting
with Franklin was a great, a memorable day for him.</p>
<p>The American commissioners were indeed unable to
obtain a better ship for him than the Ranger, and Paul
Jones returned to his little vessel sore-hearted from his
disappointment, but with the authority to rank all officers
of American ships in European waters, and with perfect
freedom to make his cruise as he liked. He determined,
as he always did, to make the best of what he had. His
first duty was to convoy a number of American merchant
vessels from Nantes into Quiberon Bay, where a large
French fleet, under Admiral La Motte Picquet, was to
sail for America. There was now no need for disguising
the character of the Ranger, and she sailed openly as a
man-of-war. Paul Jones, with resistless energy, had
worked at his ship until he had remedied many of her
defects. Her lower masts were shortened; she was
ballasted with lead; and she was much improved, as
every ship that he commanded was improved by him.
He also had, as a tender, the brig Independence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>It was on the 13th of February, 1778, that Paul Jones,
flying the Stars and Stripes for the first time in the presence
of a foreign fleet, anchored off the bay at Quiberon.
He had a motive in not coming in the bay, and this was,
as he had told Franklin, to have the flag of the United
States saluted in open day by the French admiral. The
treaty of alliance between the United States and France
was not then published, and it required much address to
obtain a salute.</p>
<p>As soon as the Ranger dropped her anchor Paul Jones
sent his boat off to the French admiral, desiring to know,
if he saluted the admiral&rsquo;s ship, if the salute would be returned.</p>
<p>Paul Jones remained walking the quarter-deck of the
Ranger until the boat was seen pulling back. A letter
was handed him from the French admiral, which he
eagerly opened.</p>
<p>The letter stated courteously that the salute would be
returned, but with four guns less than the American ship
fired, as it was the custom in the French navy to fire four
guns less to a republic than the salute offered.</p>
<p>Paul Jones immediately went below, where he wrote
the following spirited letter to the American agent at the
port:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>&ldquo;I think the admiral&rsquo;s answer requires some explanation.
The haughty English return gun for gun to foreign
officers of equal rank, and two less only by captains to
flag officers. It is true my command is not important,
yet, as the senior American officer at present in Europe
it is my duty to claim an equal return of respect to the
flag of the United States <i>that would be shown to any other
flag whatever</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I therefore take the liberty of inclosing an
appointment<a class="fn" id="fr_3" href="#fn_3">[3]</a> as respectable as any the French admiral can produce.
If, however, he persists in refusing to return an
equal salute, I will accept of two guns less, as I have not
the rank of an admiral.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this he added, that unless his flag should be properly
saluted he would certainly depart without coming
into the bay.</p>
<p>Next day, however, he discovered that the French
admiral was acting in good faith, and could not, according
to his regulations, return gun for gun to the flag of a
republic; and therefore Paul Jones determined to accept
of the salute offered.</p>
<p>The wind was blowing hard, and the sea very high, so
that it was after sunset before the Ranger could get near
enough to the admiral&rsquo;s ship to salute. The brig Independence
had been ordered to lay off the bay for a
particular purpose. Paul Jones was afraid that some advantage
might be taken of the salute being fired in semi-darkness&mdash;such
as saying the flag was mistaken for another&mdash;and
he determined to have a salute also in broad
daylight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>The short February twilight was fast going, and the
wind drove the lowering clouds furiously across the sky,
when the Ranger, under close-reefed topsails, entered the
bay and sailed close under the lee of the admiral&rsquo;s ship,
where she hove to. Instantly her guns thundered out
thirteen times. The report echoed over the dark water,
where the great French fleet, looming up grandly in the
half-darkness, lay majestically at anchor. As soon as the
last gun had been fired the admiral&rsquo;s ship promptly gave
back nine guns. The Ranger then returned to the mouth
of the bay, where she anchored alongside of the Independence,
the wind having abated.</p>
<p>Next morning&mdash;a beautiful, bright day&mdash;Paul Jones
sent word to the French admiral that he intended sailing
through the French fleet in the brig and again saluting
him, to which the admiral returned a courteous reply.</p>
<p>About ten o&rsquo;clock in the morning Paul Jones went on
board the Independence, which then stood boldly in the
harbor. She was a beautiful, clipper-built brig, and as
clean and fresh as hands could make her. A splendid
new American flag floated proudly from her mizzen peak.</p>
<p>The French fleet was anchored in two great lines,
rather wide apart, with the flagship in the middle of the
outer line. The Independence, with all her canvas set,
entered between the two rows of ships. Her guns were
manned, and Paul Jones, in full uniform, stood on the
quarter-deck. As the Independence came abreast of the
flagship the brig fired thirteen guns with the most beautiful
precision and with exactly the same interval between
each report. The admiral paid the American the
compliment of having his guns already manned, and as
the little Independence passed gracefully down the line,
enveloped like a veil in the white smoke from her own
guns, the flagship roared out nine guns from her great
thirty-six-pounders. Paul Jones&rsquo;s satisfaction was seen
on his face, although he said no word; but as soon as he
returned on board the Ranger he wrote to Franklin a joyous
letter, telling him of the honor paid the American
flag.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>From this on the relations between the officers of the
French fleet and the two American vessels were most
cordial. The Frenchmen had heard of Paul Jones as an
enterprising and promising officer, and his running under
the guns of the Solebay had become generally known in
Europe, much to the chagrin of the Solebay&rsquo;s officers. The
Count d&rsquo;Orvilliers, one of the highest officers in the service
of France, thought that, as France and America were
bound to be shortly allied, that it would be well for Paul
Jones to hold a captain&rsquo;s commission in the French navy as
well as an American commission. But this he declined.
An American commission was good enough for Paul
Jones.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER VI.</span></h2>
<p>It was upon the 10th of April, 1778, that Paul Jones
sailed from Brest upon the first of his two immortal
cruises.</p>
<p>The respect with which he had been treated, and the
dignity he maintained, had had great effect upon the officers
and men under him. They knew neither the time
nor the place of the enterprise they were entering upon;
but that it was bold and venturesome they were well
assured. The seas were swarming with British cruisers,
and alone among this multitude of enemies the little
Ranger sailed gallantly. As she passed out of the harbor
of Brest the sailors on the French ships gave her a ringing
cheer, to which the Americans responded.</p>
<p>Paul Jones then called his officers around him, and his
daring words were plainly audible to many of the men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I propose to steer straight for
the Irish Sea. What my plans are I shall tell you when
we are in sight of the three kingdoms. I know every
foot of the narrow seas, and every bay, inlet, and headland
on the shores of Scotland and Ireland. Give me
your full support, and we shall return covered with
glory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A shout of applause greeted these brave words.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>As soon as the Ranger was out of sight of land every
effort was made to disguise her as a merchantman. Her
guns were hid, and her white sails were daubed with lamp-black,
to give the idea of being old and patched. The
crew was kept below as much as possible, to be out of
sight, and in this guise she made boldly for St. George&rsquo;s
Channel.</p>
<p>On the night of the 14th of April, while standing in
between Cape Clear and the Scilly Isles, the lookout on
the quarter sang out, &ldquo;Sail, ho!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sail was a fine, large brigantine, which allowed
the strange ship, which she took for a merchantman, to
approach quite near her, as if to pass on the opposite
tack. Suddenly the strange ship doubled on her quarter
and came bearing down upon her, and at the same moment
a blank cartridge was fired across her bows. The
brigantine hove to in obedience to this peremptory command,
and hailed the approaching Ranger. To this hail
the sailing master of the Ranger replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the United States ship Ranger, and you are
her prize.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Resistance was useless. The ship contained a valuable
cargo, but no attempt was made to take anything except
what could be easily transferred to the Ranger. Paul
Jones had determined not to fire the ship, lest her burning
should attract other vessels that swarmed the narrow
seas, and thereby raise an alarm on land. Therefore he
sent the carpenter and all his mates on board to scuttle
her. The captain and crew of the brigantine were
brought off, and the carpenters went to work with a will.
In two hours from the time that she had been sailing
confidently along, unsuspicious of an enemy, the brigantine
had disappeared from the face of the ocean.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>Three days now passed in cruising about St. George&rsquo;s
Channel. So great was the number of ships, both men-of-war
and merchantmen, in sight and passing at all times,
that Captain Jones did not consider it prudent to attack,
because no man excelled Paul Jones in the prudence of
the valiant. Several times during those three days and
nights vessels that would have been valuable prizes
were close under the guns of the little Ranger, but the
presence of a frigate or two or other ship of war in the
distance made an attack impracticable. Back and forth
for three days and nights Paul Jones sailed dauntlessly
among a multitude of enemies, thus venturing boldly into
the very nest of the hornets. On the evening of the third
day, the 17th of April, a large merchant vessel was seen off
the coast of Ireland. No ship of war was in sight, and the
Ranger therefore gave chase. Within an hour or two the
vessel was overhauled, almost at the mouth of the Liffey.
A blank cartridge fired across her bows and the Ranger&rsquo;s
hoisting the American ensign brought her to. She proved
to be the Lord Chatham, fast and new, bound for Dublin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can not sink so good a ship as this,&rdquo; said Paul
Jones to his first lieutenant. &ldquo;And, besides, the scheme I
have in view does not permit us to encumber ourselves
with prisoners. She will answer excellently to carry our
prisoners back to Brest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A prize crew and an officer were therefore thrown on
board the Lord Chatham, the prisoners transferred, and
she was carried off when almost within sight of her port.
Paul Jones then put out to the open sea again, and
steered straight for the coast of Scotland.</p>
<p>On the 18th of April, a beautiful, mild evening, he entered
the Frith of Solway. It was the first time his eyes
had rested on it, except for one brief and unhappy visit,
since his childhood. He was now an American officer,
of the highest rank possible to give him in the infant
navy of the colonies, and it was his plain duty to use
the knowledge he had of the Scotch coast in the service
of his country.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>The port of Whitehaven, on the opposite side of the
Solway, was the point Paul Jones meant to attack. Here
was collected a great company of shipping, estimated at
between two and three hundred sail. The Ranger was,
as usual, closely disguised, and excited no suspicion as
she entered the Solway. The evening was beautiful and
bright, but as the sun went down the indications of a
hard squall became evident. The furious tides rushed in,
driven by a rising gale from the Irish Sea, and the wind
blew directly on shore.</p>
<p>Paul Jones determined to wait for night to complete
his design, and when it grew too dark for the Ranger to
be distinguished from another ship he ordered the men
mustered on deck. Then, in a few decisive words, he
announced his plan to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall have a chance,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to avenge some
of the dreadful burnings practiced uselessly upon our own
coasts; but this will not be useless. The fleet now collected
at Whitehaven is the coal fleet for Ireland. To destroy
it would be to embarrass the enemy greatly. I call for
thirty volunteers to assist me in this patriotic work. No
man need go unless he wants to. But those who share
with me the danger of this enterprise will also share with
me the glory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It seemed as if every man on the deck shouted &ldquo;I,
sir,&rdquo; and &ldquo;I!&rdquo; and &ldquo;I!&rdquo; and &ldquo;I!&rdquo; and loud among the
voices sounded the piping treble of little Danny Dixon.
Paul Jones raised his hand to command silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall have to choose thirty men, because I can not take
you all. I shall take the strongest and most active men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that he told off thirty men, including Bill Green,
the quartermaster. But when the number was selected,
and the men had gone forward, Paul Jones noticed that
Danny, the cabin boy, lingered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>&ldquo;If you please, sir,&rdquo; said Danny, diffidently, &ldquo;you
surely ain&rsquo;t a-goin&rsquo; to leave me behind, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you are nothing but a lad,&rdquo; answered Paul
Jones. &ldquo;This is an enterprise for men, not boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it, sir. But I ain&rsquo;t afraid o&rsquo; nothin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Paul Jones was about to reply, but at that moment
Mr. Stacy, the sailing master, came up hurriedly, to say
that at the rate the wind was rising and shifting it was
necessary to claw off the land, and he thought a landing
would be impossible that night. A few minutes convinced
Paul Jones that his sailing master was right, and
that the enterprise would have to be postponed. The
Ranger was driving furiously before the wind, and at
every lurch she buried her nose deep in the foaming
waves. The gale shrieked angrily, and a bank of coppery
clouds in the west darkened ominously. The ship
was therefore brought about, and under straining canvas
she beat her way back to the mouth of the Solway.</p>
<p>No man slept on the Ranger that night. The weather
was thick, and Paul Jones was averse to running into the
open sea for safety. The next morning dawned clear,
but windy. The ship was close enough to the shores of
Scotland to be seen from a hundred hamlets, and her situation
became too risky to let anything escape that could
tell on her. A revenue wherry was seen, chased and
cannonaded, but escaped. A coasting vessel was overhauled,
her crew taken out of her, and she was then
scuttled and sunk; so was a Dublin schooner, while a
cutter seen off the lee bow was chased into the Clyde,
and up as far as the Rock of Ailsa. The weather still
prevented a descent upon the coast, but Paul Jones
boldly awaited his chance to make it, in spite of the enemies
that swarmed around him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>Boldness meant prudence in the affair Paul Jones had
undertaken, and therefore, not wishing to remain too
long in any locality, he again stood across the Irish Sea,
and entered the Lough of Belfast, off which lay the town
of Carrickfergus.</p>
<p>It was on the afternoon of the 21st of April. The
Ranger, sailing with a long leg and a short one, cautiously
approached the roadstead. Never was there a lovelier
scene. The harbor was of a deep ultramarine blue, and
a faint golden haze enveloped sky and sea and castle and
ships. Upon a grandly projecting cliff stood the stern
gray castle, with its twenty-two great guns, frowning
upon the rippling water. Out in the soft, yet dazzling, afternoon
light lay a sloop of war, about the size of the Ranger.
A gentle breeze fanned the Union Jack that floated
from her mizzen peak. Over the whole scene was the
still beauty of &ldquo;a painted ship upon a painted ocean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The officers of the Ranger were all on deck, for in
that perilous cruise neither officers nor men went below
except for necessary food and sleep. Paul Jones, with his
glass, carefully examined the ship, and then, turning to his
officers, said quietly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen, here is the chance we have all longed
for. Yonder is a ship of war of a rate that we can give
battle to. We will fight that ship, and we will take her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Scarcely were the words out of the captain&rsquo;s mouth
when &ldquo;Ahoy!&rdquo; sounded from the port side of the Ranger.
A fishing boat had come alongside, with three fishermen
in it. One of them held up a string of beautiful fish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we want your fish, and you, too,&rdquo; cried Stacy, the
sailing master, at Captain Jones&rsquo;s orders; and in a few
moments, to the astonishment of the fishermen, they
were on the Ranger&rsquo;s deck, and their boat was hanging
astern.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic3">

<p class="caption"><i>The Ranger and the Drake.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>&ldquo;What is that vessel yonder?&rdquo; asked Captain Jones
of the elder man, for they proved to be a father and two
sons.</p>
<p>The man looked about him dazed for a moment. He
did not recognize Captain Jones&rsquo;s uniform, nor did he understand
the character of the vessel that looked so peaceable,
but which a close inspection proved was well able
to take care of herself in a fight. He hesitated a moment,
but one commanding look from Paul Jones brought the
truth out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the Drake, sir; sloop of war.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of how many guns?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man looked helplessly at Captain Jones, but one
of the sons answered, in a low voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some says twenty, sir, but I counted twenty-two on
&rsquo;em when I went aboard to carry my fish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who commands her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Burden, sir; Cap&rsquo;n Burden they calls him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Paul Jones&rsquo;s eyes gleamed. No better news could be
brought him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I shall have to keep you from
your families for a few days, but you shall not lose by
being my guests.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Paul Jones&rsquo;s plans were made rapidly. He was alone,
on a hostile coast, with enemies before him, behind him,
and around him. None the less did he intend to give
battle. Moreover, he knew that he was fighting with
a halter around his neck, for there was but little doubt
that if he were captured he would be hanged as a pirate,
so little were the British then disposed to recognize the
navy of the colonies. But this could not appall his
dauntless soul. He had the warm support of the best
among his officers, and among the men there was an
instinctive belief that he was always ready to fight, and
nothing so inspires a crew as the knowledge that they
have a fighting captain. Bill Green, passing back and
forth, remarked, with a wink, to a group of his messmates
forward:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>&ldquo;The Cap&rsquo;n&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to fight that &rsquo;ere Johnny Bull, sure;
and I tell you what, them Britishers will have to coil up
some o&rsquo; their nonsense about there ain&rsquo;t no sailors except
Britishers, and take in their slack about Britannia rulin&rsquo;
the waves. Something&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to happen soon, that reminds
me of a old song I heard once:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;&lsquo;Heave the topmast from the board,</p>
<p class="t">And our ship for action clear;</p>
<p class="t0">By the cannon and the sword</p>
<p class="t">We will die or conquer here.</p>
<p class="t0">To your posts, my faithful tars!</p>
<p class="t">Mind your rigging, guns, and spars!&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Ay, ay, sir! coming, sir!&rdquo;&mdash;this to Mr. Stacy, the sailing master,
who called out sharply, &ldquo;Quartermaster!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just as Bill had foreseen, the order was passed to clear
for action without the drumbeat. The guns were made
ready to run out, but kept covered, and the portlids were
not raised. The breeze was fresh, and the Ranger was
enabled to carry all her canvas. She kept warily outside
the harbor, on and off the wind, until about ten
o&rsquo;clock at night, when she stood boldly in, to bring up
athwart hawse the Drake, intending to grapple and fight
it out.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>Everything was in readiness, as the ship stole silently
in through the misty darkness of a moonless night.
Stacy, the sailing master, brought her safely within a
cable&rsquo;s length of the Drake&rsquo;s quarter. But the anchor
was let go too soon, and, instead of laying aboard the
Drake, she drifted about half a cable&rsquo;s length off. In
an instant the mistake was realized. Without a moment&rsquo;s
hesitation Captain Jones gave orders to cut the cable, and
the Ranger passed directly astern of the Drake, under her
stern chasers. No alarm was given on the war-ship; a
muttered growl from the lookout on the after quarter informed
them that they had better &ldquo;keep off&rdquo; with their
lubberly craft, which Paul Jones promptly did, intending
to return on the next tack. But the wind, which had
been squally for several days, now suddenly rose in a
fierce gust, and he was compelled to beat out of the harbor.
The gust increased to a furious gale, and it took all
of Captain Jones&rsquo;s skill to get sea room enough for safety.
The night grew pitch dark, and it was midnight before
they weathered the lighthouse point, where the warning
light shone dimly over the tempestuous sea and upon the
laboring ship. The gale continued all the next day, but
the Ranger had found a lee on the south coast, where she
awaited the abatement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind, my brave boys,&rdquo; said Paul Jones to his
men when they were driving out of the harbor. &ldquo;That
ship shall yet be ours. We can cut and come again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The men fully believed him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER VII.</span></h2>
<p>For six days the weather continued to be very uncertain,
and the Ranger ran from point to point between the
Scotch and Irish coasts, waiting for a chance to slip in
the port of Carrickfergus and have it out, yardarm to
yardarm, with the Drake. At last, on the morning of the
24th of April, Paul Jones found himself off the harbor&rsquo;s
mouth. The bay, the castled crag, the picturesque town,
and the handsome sloop of war looked as lovely in the
brilliant morning light as in the soft afternoon glow when
the Ranger had first reconnoitered the town.</p>
<p>But no longer was the American vessel unsuspected.
By the time she had passed the headland and got in full
view of the town and shipping her warlike character was
suspected, although she showed no colors, her ports were
closed, and only a few of her company were allowed upon
deck. But the Carrickfergus people had heard about the
daring American cruiser that had been hovering off the
coasts of the three kingdoms for ten days, and the Drake
felt disposed to find out the standing of the strange ship
in the offing. As the Ranger neared the harbor&rsquo;s mouth
her people could hear the creaking of the capstan and the
hoarse rattle of the hawser as the Drake&rsquo;s anchor was being
rapidly tripped. Nothing could have pleased Paul
Jones more than this, and he smiled as he said to his sailing
master:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>&ldquo;Keep off a little, Mr. Stacy. The Drake evidently
wishes for a personal interview with us, and I would like
to oblige her. I think, though, we will come about, so as
to show her as little as possible of ourselves, in order that
she may come out as far as possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Ranger then went completely about, as if she
were running away. Still she had thrown her main topsail
aback and had hauled up her courses.</p>
<p>The Drake then determined to send out a boat to reconnoiter.
As the Ranger&rsquo;s stern was still kept toward
the boat nothing could be discovered of her character,
and the boat came on within hailing distance. The
Ranger, however, did not hail. The boat continued to
advance, and finally hailed. Stacy, under Paul Jones&rsquo;s
orders, answered the hail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What ship is that?&rdquo; was called from the boat.</p>
<p>Paul Jones, standing at Stacy&rsquo;s elbow, told him in a
low voice what to say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Mind-your-business-and-keep-off,&rdquo; Stacy rattled
off so fast that he could not possibly be understood.</p>
<p>The boat stopped for a moment and then pulled a little
nearer, and the officer in it stood up and shouted in a
clear voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What ship is that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The worst we&rsquo;ve seen for ten years,&rdquo; bawled Stacy,
pretending that he understood the hail to be about the
voyage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a fool,&rdquo; called the officer, examining the
ship carefully as the boat rapidly pulled nearer and
nearer, but still puzzled by her. &ldquo;I asked the name of
your ship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Much obliged for your information,&rdquo; Stacy answered,
&ldquo;particularly as it&rsquo;s the hardest thing in the world generally
for a respectable merchant vessel to get a civil word
out of you cocky man-of-war&rsquo;s people.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>By this time the boat was directly under the Ranger&rsquo;s
quarter, and there could be no pretense of not understanding
the officer&rsquo;s final hail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ask you, for the third time, what ship is that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I answer, for the third time, she is the Lord
Chatham, bound for Leith from Dublin, short of&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Water,&rdquo; suggested Paul Jones. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the only
thing we are not short of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Short of water,&rdquo; continued Stacy; and then, prompted
again by Paul Jones, he cried:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you heard anything of that American cruiser
which has been prowling about, capturing merchant
ships and frightening the coast people out of their
wits?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the officer, now completely off his guard.
&ldquo;We would give a thousand pounds to meet her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our captain says come aboard, then,&rdquo; said Stacy,
&ldquo;and he can give you some information about the Ranger
that he guarantees is absolutely true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boat then came alongside, a ladder was lowered,
and the officer came up on the port side. Just then one
of the Ranger&rsquo;s boats was dropped from the davits; it
was quickly filled with men, and in another minute the
men in the Drake&rsquo;s boat were informed that they were
prisoners. As the officer stepped upon deck Paul Jones
advanced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry to begin our acquaintance so unpleasantly,
sir, but you are my prisoner. This is the American
sloop of war Ranger, and I am Captain Paul Jones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The officer uttered an exclamation of anger. The
name of Paul Jones was already well known, and one
glance had shown him the true state of affairs.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>&ldquo;Make yourself as easy as possible,&rdquo; said Paul Jones.
&ldquo;Yours is the fortune of war; but you will be treated
with every consideration, and will, no doubt, be shortly
exchanged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other officers then came forward and politely
condoled with the unlucky officer, while his men were
sent below.</p>
<p>The whole thing had been witnessed from the Drake,
which now had no doubt of the Ranger&rsquo;s character, and
lost no time in preparing to come out. The alarm had
been given, and five vessels, filled with people anxious to
see the contest between the two ships, put off from the
shore. Alarm fires were set blazing, and the black smoke
was wafted high in the noonday light. The tide was unfavorable,
so that the Drake worked out very slowly.
The Ranger now threw off every disguise. Her guns
were run out and her men called to quarters by the tap
of the drum, and she waited gallantly for her adversary.
She drifted fast to windward, so that she was several
times forced to put up her helm in order to run down
toward her enemy, when she would throw her main topsail
aback and lie with her courses in the brails.</p>
<p>The men were at their quarters, but laughing, joking,
and singing, as it was the custom to permit them a little
jollity at the moment of going into battle. They watched
the Drake making her way slowly, with light and baffling
winds, toward mid-channel, and exchanged squibs and
songs about her. Bill Green was in his glory. As he
was to take the wheel as soon as the ball opened, he was
relieved until the first lieutenant called him. Paul Jones
was very glad to have him relieved, as his songs inspired
the men. Bill, seated on one of the long guns, with folded
arms and his cap stuck rakishly on the back of his
head, proceeded to troll out, in his rich voice, one of his
favorite songs, which he claimed to have composed expressly
for the occasion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>

<p>Loud cheers and laughter greeted this song, the officers
smiling at the enthusiasm aroused, and Paul Jones
handed Bill two gold pieces.</p>

he, &ldquo;and the Ranger will never discredit the flag she

<p>Thus, in good spirits and with bold composure, the
Ranger&rsquo;s people spent the golden hours of the forenoon
and a part of the afternoon, waiting for their gallant
enemy.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>It was well on toward four o&rsquo;clock before the Drake
weathered the headland, and lay a straight course for the
saucy American, that was waiting for her under easy canvas.
As the Drake stood for the American ship she set
her colors, and at the same moment the Ranger flung out
the Stars and Stripes. No more songs and laughter then.
Everybody was ready, and grimly expectant. Danny
Dixon, beating the drum, walked once around the ship to
give warning that the action was about to begin.</p>
<p>The Ranger filled on the starboard tack, and stood off
the land so as to engage in mid-channel. Here was indeed
an enterprise that would have appalled a less daring
spirit than that of Paul Jones. He was alone, in the narrow
seas of the greatest naval power on earth, with the
land as well as the water crowded with his enemies.
The hillsides were full of people, and the shores were
alive with boats. The three kingdoms were in plain
sight, and he, with one small sloop of war, stood ready to
give battle to a hitherto unconquered foe. But literally,
the sense of fear seemed unknown to Paul Jones, and
great as might be the odds against him, greater was the
genius with which he could withstand them.</p>
<p>The Drake, having approached within hail, spoke the
Ranger, as a matter of form. The voices echoed clearly
over the water in the still, sunny, spring afternoon, and it
was plainly seen in the mellow light that Paul Jones, who
stood by the sailing master&rsquo;s side on the Ranger, dictated
the reply, which was a cool defiance in these words:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the Continental ship Ranger. We wait for
you, and beg you will come on. The sun is but little
more than an hour high, and it is time to begin.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>Scarcely were the words spoken, when the Ranger&rsquo;s
helm was ported, and, bringing her broadside to bear on
the advancing ship, she roared out the first volley. The
Drake answered it promptly, and in another moment the
ships were running free, close together, under a light
wind, and keeping up a furious cannonade.</p>
<p>On board the Ranger, Paul Jones walked the quarter-deck
unharmed, amid a shower of musketry, which the
Americans returned with interest. Captain Burden, of
the Drake, showed an equal disregard of danger, but
within half an hour of the firing of the first broadside
he was mortally wounded by a musket shot in the
head. The fire of the Ranger was much more effective
than the Drake&rsquo;s, and the damage done by her guns was
terrific. The Drake&rsquo;s fore and main topsail yards were
completely shot away, the main topgallant mast and
mizzen gaff hanging up and down the mast, her jib hanging
over her lee into the water, her sails and rigging in
rags, and she had been hulled repeatedly. Twice had
her ensign been shot away, and twice the gallant British
tars had hoisted it, but just as the sun was sinking, when
the captain and first lieutenant of the Drake and forty of
her officers and men lay killed or wounded upon her
decks, the ensign was dragged down from the shattered
spar to which it hung, and a cry for &ldquo;Quarter! quarter!&rdquo;
resounded. Instantly the Americans ceased firing, and in
another minute they had boarded the Drake and hoisted
an American ensign upon what was left of the foremast.
The sun was now going down, and the long spring twilight
was upon them.</p>
<p>Paul Jones had seen Captain Burden fall, and his first
inquiry was, &ldquo;Does the captain still live?&rdquo; He indeed
breathed a few times, but in a little while all was over.
The first lieutenant, who was mortally wounded, survived
for two days.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>Like most men of great imaginative qualities, Paul
Jones had a tender heart. The sight of the dead and
wounded always affected him, and the spectacle of
brave men dying in gallant combat with him touched
him peculiarly. In spite of his hazardous position&mdash;for he
was still in the midst of enormous danger, with a crippled
ship to take care of&mdash;he ordered the dead removed below,
the captain being laid out in the cabin and covered with
the tattered ensign he had so well defended, and the
wounded promptly attended to. Meanwhile the Ranger,
which was comparatively uninjured, and had only lost one
officer and one man, gave a tow-line to the Drake, and
passed out of the lough and up St. George&rsquo;s Channel.
As soon as a place of comparative safety was reached,
about midnight, the Ranger hove to, and preparations
were made to bury the dead with suitable honors.</p>
<p>The night sky was clear, and overhead, in the blue-black
vault, the cold, bright stars shone steadily. A fair
wind slightly ruffled the surface of the ocean, and the two
ships looked huge and shadowy in the mysterious half
darkness. Few lights were shown, and in the midst of a
deep and awful stillness the boatswain&rsquo;s pipe resounded
with the solemn call, &ldquo;All hands on deck to bury the
dead!&rdquo; The flags on both ships were half-masted out of
respect to the dead. On the quarter-deck lay the body
of Captain Burden, wrapped in the flag for which he had
given his life. Next him lay the body of Lieutenant Wallingford,
of the Ranger, covered with the American flag.
Then came the bodies of eight British sailors and one
American, sewn up in canvas, and on them, too, lay the
colors of their country. The gangway was open and the
plank lay ready. The British officers were on deck to see
the last honors paid their shipmates, while the other prisoners
were permitted to watch from the open portholes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>Paul Jones, in the absence of a chaplain, read the
burial service himself over the brave men who had so
gallantly fallen that day in fair and patriotic fight. His
voice sounded inexpressibly solemn as he raised it in
the inspiring words: &ldquo;I am the resurrection and the life.
If a man shall believe on Me, though he be dead, yet shall
he live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the short but impressive ceremony was over,
the body of Captain Burden was first dropped overboard,
followed by that of poor Wallingford. The sailors&rsquo; bodies
followed in order. As the last dull splash showed that
the melancholy duty was over, the flags were run up as if
by magic on the two ships, and the bugler piped a merry
call. Then every man went to work with a will, taking
advantage of the clear night and good weather to get the
shattered Drake into condition, and the sounds of cheerful
toil resounded the whole night through.</p>
<p>It was Paul Jones&rsquo;s determination to carry the captured
Drake directly to France, for he was the last man
in the world to abandon so gallant a trophy. He had on
board the Ranger about a hundred and forty prisoners,
including the wounded, and with his small crew he managed
to take care of them and repair partially the damage
done the unfortunate Drake.</p>
<p>The men continued to work with the fierce energy
that characterized those acting under Paul Jones&rsquo;s command,
and within twenty-four hours jury masts had been
set up and rigged, new sails had been bent, the holes in
the hull planked over, and Paul Jones was ready to make
his way to France.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>He had, indeed, struck terror to the trading vessels of
the region, but, the alarm being given, he knew that war-ships
were already after him. The wind shifting and
threatening a gale, he determined to pass by the north
of the channel and around the west coast of Ireland,
which would bring him directly in the spot of his performance
the day before. This Paul Jones considered
an advantage, as his enemies would scarcely be looking
for him in the very place he had just left. As he passed
so close to the port of Carrickfergus, from which he had
taken the three fishermen on the evening of the 21st, he
concluded to send them to their homes, much to their delight.
Their own boat had been lost, and he determined
to give them a good one out of the many he had on
board. It was toward dusk when the boat was lowered
and the men called upon deck.</p>
<p>Among the prisoners were two sick men from Dublin,
that Paul Jones also determined to send to their homes,
and these two were also sent for on deck. When they
arrived, Paul Jones handed them some money.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the last shilling that I have in the world
at present, but you are welcome to it,&rdquo; he said to the
sick men. They responded with a feeble but grateful
&ldquo;Thankee, sir.&rdquo; To the fisherman he said: &ldquo;The boat I
give you is yours, and in it you will find a sail of the
Drake&rsquo;s. That will show what has become of her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fishermen looked completely dazed by their good
fortune, for the boat given them was much larger and
better than their own. They recovered their senses,
though, after they got into the boat, and as they passed
under the Ranger&rsquo;s quarter they gave three rousing
cheers for Captain Jones. The captain raised his cap in
reply, and in another moment the ship was sailing past
the harbor, past the town, with its lights dimly visible,
past the castle on the rock, where a brightly lighted
tower stood watch, and, weathering the headland, she
was soon steering a straight course for the North Channel.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER VIII.</span></h2>
<p>It was a fair and lovely May morning when the Ranger,
still towing the Drake, appeared off the bay of Brest.
The American ensign was hoisted on the Drake over the
Union Jack, and this told the glorious story. Word flew
from mouth to mouth among the French men-of-war in
the roads to the people in the dockyards and the town.
A fleet of pilot boats put off, each eager to have the
honor of taking the Ranger and her prize in through
the narrow and dangerous channel of Le Goulet. Paul
Jones stood on his quarter-deck, as calm and easy as
ever, but his soul thrilled with patriotic pride. The
British had denounced him as a pirate, a traitor, and
a felon, and he had had first, the justifiable revenge of
showing himself alone and undaunted in the midst of his
enemies, capturing a ship of equal size and force, and
afterward, the nobler revenge of treating his prisoners
with the utmost kindness and courtesy. As the Ranger
passed the flagship she gave thirteen guns, and every ship
in the French squadron in return saluted the flag flying at
the Ranger&rsquo;s mizzen peak. The French sailors manned
the yards of the flagship without orders, and a volley of
cheers mingled with the hoarse thunder of the guns as
the little American vessel made her way cautiously up
the narrow channel. The great clouds of white smoke
rose in the clear May sunshine, and almost hid the Ranger&rsquo;s
hull and that of her consort: but high above the
white and drifting mist the American ensign floated
proudly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>Paul Jones was greeted with the most intense enthusiasm
among the naval men at Brest, and France rang
with his exploits. Benjamin Franklin wrote him letters
of affectionate praise, and the French Minister of Marine,
M. de Sartine, requested the American commissioners to
detain Captain Jones in Europe, as it was desired to employ
him against the British, in conjunction with the
French fleets. War between France and England was
then imminent, and, in fact, was declared within a few
weeks. Paul Jones therefore wrote to the Congress,
saying he desired that no command be reserved for him,
as he had been directed by the American commissioners
to remain in France.</p>
<p>And now, in place of these bright anticipations came a
long and torturing period of suspense for Paul Jones, mingled,
it is true, with many compliments on his prowess,
and sustained by the friendship of Franklin, of the King
of France, of the Duke de Chartres, and the admiration
of all the naval and military men of France. More than
that was the gratitude and respect of the men who had
fought under him, and of the two hundred prisoners from
the Drake&mdash;for Paul Jones&rsquo;s conduct at this time gained
him the lasting good will of these men. The affairs of
the American Government had then reached their most
desperate state, and the French Government was a government
by intrigue and corruption, which, not many
years after, produced the bloodiest revolution the world
ever saw. No money was forthcoming as the prize justly
earned by the Ranger&rsquo;s officers and crew, nor were they
even paid their wages while waiting at Brest for a promised
ship for Paul Jones. Worse still was the condition
of the English prisoners, who would actually have starved
but for Paul Jones himself paying out of his own pocket
for food to keep them alive. It was his earnest desire to
secure an exchange of prisoners, so that he could get a
crew made up wholly of Americans, but with the general
trickery, inefficiency, and jealousy of the French administration
he could do nothing. One fine ship after another
was promised him, through Benjamin Franklin, who
looked to Paul Jones as the hope of the new nation upon
the seas, but disappointment followed disappointment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>Paul Jones&rsquo;s restless spirit was the last one to submit
to this enforced idleness, and he complained in his letters
that &ldquo;this shameful inactivity is worse to me than a
thousand deaths.&rdquo; Every moment lost to the service of
his country was, in Paul Jones&rsquo;s esteem, &ldquo;shameful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So months passed, Paul Jones in his small lodging at
Brest vainly endeavoring, with Franklin&rsquo;s earnest help,
to get afloat once more in any sort of a ship. The King
of France requested him to write a full account of the
Ranger&rsquo;s daring cruise, which Paul Jones did. But fighting,
not writing, was his choice when his country needed
every arm that could be raised in her defense.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>Bill Green, the quartermaster, whose time was up,
had elected to stay with Paul Jones until he had another
ship, and little Danny Dixon followed him about like a
dog. The two humble friends gave Paul Jones more real
comfort than all the compliments showered upon him by
people of rank and consequence. Danny was still &ldquo;the
captain&rsquo;s boy,&rdquo; and Bill Green had a humble sleeping
place close by the captain&rsquo;s lodgings. When successive
disappointments had preyed upon Paul Jones&rsquo;s bold spirit,
and he would return home in the evening sad and dispirited,
the sight of Danny&rsquo;s affectionate eyes and anxiety
to serve him would sometimes console him a little. Bill
Green was always at hand to carry a letter or a message,
and Paul Jones, in his temporary distress, did not lack for
two devoted friends. Bill had quite adopted Danny by
this time, but was always growling and grumbling about
&ldquo;ships&rsquo; boys as is more trouble than they&rsquo;re wuth,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;boys as oughter have the cat reg&rsquo;lar along with their
&rsquo;lowance.&rdquo; He did not sing much, though; and when
Danny would tease him to sing &ldquo;Come, all ye tars that
brave the sea,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I&rsquo;m here and there a jolly dog,&rdquo; Bill
would shake his head and say dolefully: &ldquo;No, boy. I
can&rsquo;t sing them songs without I can hear the water runnin&rsquo;
against the ship&rsquo;s side and the wind makin&rsquo; music
through the riggin&rsquo;, and the bo&rsquo;s&rsquo;n&rsquo;s pipe once in a while.
Them is sea songs, and the only land song <i>I</i> knows is
&lsquo;Land lubbers lie down below,&rsquo; and that ain&rsquo;t no song to
speak of. Landsmen ain&rsquo;t got no music of no account;
and as for their songs&mdash;Lord! they&rsquo;re all about love and
the moon, and that sort o&rsquo; loblolly that sailormen ain&rsquo;t got
no appetite for.&rdquo; Danny, perforce, had to put up with
this explanation, and do without Bill&rsquo;s music.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>Meanwhile, so great had been the alarm upon the
coast of the United Kingdoms that the British Admiralty
had issued a circular letter warning the people living on
the coasts that a descent by Paul Jones might be expected.
This further stung the daring sailor, who beheld the days
go by fruitlessly while he lingered at Brest, unable to
get a vessel. At one time it was thought a ship had been
secured for him, and the young Lafayette, then on a visit
from America, desired to sail with him in command of
some troops that he was to carry. Afterward this design
failed, and Lafayette wrote to Paul Jones: &ldquo;I can not tell
you, my good friend, how sorry I am not to be a witness
of your success, abilities, and glory.&rdquo; At last, nearly a
year after his glorious cruise in the Ranger, Paul Jones,
in despair of doing better, accepted the command of the
Duc de Duras&mdash;the ship that, under the new name of the
Bon Homme Richard, was to immortalize herself and the
great man who became her captain. She was reported to
be new and fast, but turned out, though, to be old and
much decayed. She was a long ship, and carried twenty-four
guns in broadside and eighteen smaller guns. She
had a crew of three hundred and eighty men, of all nationalities
under the sun. Not more than thirty of them were
Americans, but among these Americans, besides Bill Green
and two or three other men who had sailed with him in
the Ranger, Paul Jones had Stacy, his old sailing master.
He had the name of the ship changed from the Duc de
Duras to the Bon Homme Richard, in compliment to Dr.
Franklin, whose Poor Richard&rsquo;s Almanac was then making
a great stir in the world.</p>
<p>The Bon Homme Richard was to be the first ship in
a motley squadron made up of the Alliance, a fine American
frigate of thirty-six guns, with an American crew, but
commanded by a French captain. Of this man&mdash;Captain
Landais&mdash;it is proper to say in the beginning that he had
a distinct tinge of madness in his composition, and it is
generally agreed that he was not thoroughly sane at any
time during the memorable cruise he made with Paul
Jones. He had been compelled to leave the French navy
upon the ground of an intolerable temper, which was the
beginning of the insanity from which he undoubtedly suffered
at one time during his life. He had been considered
a brave and faithful officer under the old <i>r&eacute;gime</i> of the
French navy, and therefore his subsequent conduct to
Commodore Jones, as Paul Jones had now become, is
entitled to the doubt that he was not responsible for what
he did. Franklin, however, did not think this, and in a
letter written afterward to the officers and men of the
Bon Homme Richard, expressed the difference between
Paul Jones and Landais thus: &ldquo;For Captain Paul Jones
ever loved close fighting, but Landais was skillful in keeping
out of harm&rsquo;s way.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>The third ship of the squadron, the Pallas, was frigate
built, and carried thirty-two guns. Then there was the
Vengeance, a brig carrying twelve guns, and a small but
beautiful cutter of eighteen guns, the Cerf. Paul Jones
was the commodore of this little squadron, but there
seems to have been great uncertainty about his powers.</p>
<p>Not more than thirty Americans were available for the
Bon Homme Richard at first, but Commodore Jones
managed so that most of the petty officers were Americans.
The rest of the crew were a motley set, of every
nation under the sun. But along with his good luck in
having Mr. Stacy and Bill Green, of his old company,
he was to have a young lieutenant who was worthy to
carry out the orders of such a man as Paul Jones.</p>
<p>The Bon Homme Richard was fitting out at L&rsquo;Orient,
when one day, as Paul Jones was standing on the dock
looking at the ship, that resounded with the clamor of
preparation, a handsome young fellow of twenty-three,
wearing an American naval uniform, stepped up to him
and spoke, saluting at the same time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is Commodore Jones, I presume, and I am
Lieutenant Dale,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Paul Jones grasped his hand cordially.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have heard of you, Mr. Dale. And how did you
get the British uniform with which you escaped from
Mill Prison?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>Dale shook his head and smiled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>&ldquo;That secret must remain with me until the end of
time,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But I have had enough of British prisons.
After my first escape and recapture every amusement
was forbidden me; and so, as I had nothing else
to do, I was forced to sing patriotic songs to keep up my
spirits; and for that I spent forty days in the Black
Hole.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Something like a smile shone in Paul Jones&rsquo;s dark and
somber eyes. He had heard of the young lieutenant captured
on the Lexington, confined in Mill Prison, and who
had once escaped only to be recaptured, but this time had
succeeded in getting out of harm&rsquo;s way while the British
police scoured the city of London for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were you ordered to report to me, Mr. Dale?&rdquo;
asked Paul Jones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; answered Dale; &ldquo;but I desire to see service,
and those who serve under you will stand an excellent
chance of immortality, for, as Dr. Franklin says, &lsquo;Captain
Paul Jones ever loves close fighting.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Paul Jones took off his cap at the mention of Dr.
Franklin&rsquo;s name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The praise of that great man is ever dear to me; and
for yourself, Mr. Dale, your skill and intrepidity are well
known, and your escape from Mill Prison shows that you
are no ordinary man, and I shall be happy to have you as
my first lieutenant on the Bon Homme Richard,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>At this Dale&rsquo;s fine face turned crimson with pleasure.
He expressed his thanks with a confusion that was more
eloquent than the most finished periods.</p>
<p>There were two other American lieutenants attached
to the Bon Homme Richard&mdash;Henry Lunt and Cutting
Lunt&mdash;but Bill Green, after inspecting them all, reported
as follows to little Danny Dixon, who religiously believed
everything Bill Green told him:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>&ldquo;They all do tollerbul well; but Mr. Dale, he&rsquo;s a seaman,
he is. I knowed it. And I tell you, boy, he ain&rsquo;t
never goin&rsquo; to surrender. He&rsquo;s been took prisoner now
three times, and he&rsquo;s a-goin&rsquo; to die ruther &rsquo;n go back to
the Black Hole. And you mind your eye, young &rsquo;un,
when you&rsquo;re round Mr. Dale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord knows I does,&rdquo; earnestly responded Danny.</p>
<p>Early in June the squadron started on a cruise that
was destined to be only the prelude of the immortal cruise
that made Paul Jones&rsquo;s name known all over the civilized
world. On the very night they left the roads of Groix
Paul Jones discovered the manner of man he had to deal
with in Captain Landais. The tide was running in powerfully
strong from the Bay of Biscay, and the Bon Homme
Richard and the Alliance were coming dangerously near
each other. Dale, who had the deck, had the helm put
up, expecting the Alliance to put her helm up also to
avoid a collision. Instead of that, the Alliance, under
Captain Landais&rsquo;s direction, deliberately kept her luff and
crashed into the Bon Homme Richard, carrying away
some of the lighter spars of both ships. Paul Jones, who
was in the cabin, ran on deck, and in a few minutes the
ships were free. The damage was not great, but Dale&rsquo;s
account of the way the Alliance was man&oelig;uvred was very
disquieting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The captain was on deck, sir, and with a pistol at
the helmsman&rsquo;s head forced him to keep his luff, and
swore at him most frightfully all the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dale,&rdquo; said Paul Jones in a troubled voice, &ldquo;we have
undoubtedly a madman to deal with. What terrible thing
may he not yet do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Landais&rsquo;s conduct during the whole cruise was of the
same character, but there was so much malice in his cunning,
and his seamanship, when he chose, was so good,
that no man in the squadron really knew whether Landais
was insane or not.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>The spirits of the crew were excellent, and Bill Green
and the other members of it who had been on the expedition
with the Drake did not let them forget that they
were with a &ldquo;lucky cap&rsquo;n.&rdquo; On the very first night out,
when those that were off duty were sitting around the
foks&rsquo;l, Bill announced that he had composed a song,
words and music, descriptive of the capture of the
Drake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have it, quartermaster,&rdquo; said the boatswain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t hardly fittin&rsquo; to sing,&rdquo; answered Bill deprecatingly.
&ldquo;It begins sumpin&rsquo; about you: &lsquo;&ldquo;A sail! all
hands!&rdquo; the boatswain cries.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems to me,&rdquo; said the boatswain, with a wink to the
men, &ldquo;I heard that &rsquo;ere song, or one monstrous like it,
while we was at L&rsquo;Orient, and somebody said as it were
composed by a officer&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t heard no sich a thing,&rdquo; tartly answered
Bill. &ldquo;I thought it out in the dog-watch last night, and I
wrote it out at nigh eight bells this mornin&rsquo;. I ain&rsquo;t got
no need to sing other folks&rsquo;s songs. <i>I</i> got the savey to
make &rsquo;em up and sing &rsquo;em too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then shake out your reefs and go ahead,&rdquo; said the
boatswain; and after the regulation amount of urging
from his mates Bill began:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;&lsquo;A sail! all hands!&rsquo; the boatswain pipes,</p>
<p class="t">And instant at the signal sound,</p>
<p class="t0">Beneath the waving Stars and Stripes,</p>

<p>This song was greeted with great applause, and Bill
stoutly claimed the honor of its composition.</p>
<p>The cruise was uneventful except for the capture of a
few prizes, and, battered by the storms in the Bay of Biscay,
the squadron returned to L&rsquo;Orient to refit. Here
Paul Jones had the good luck to find a considerable number
of Americans who were anxious to enlist with him.
Every quarter-deck officer was an American except one
midshipman. Paul Jones distributed the Americans
among his crew, so that nearly all the petty officers were
of the sort described by Washington when he said, &ldquo;Put
none but Americans on guard.&rdquo; Many of the ordinary
seamen, though, were of other nationalities.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>At last the necessary repairs were made, and at daybreak
on the morning of the 14th of August Paul Jones
set sail, with a premonition that, even with an inferior
ship and a squadron unworthy to serve under him, he
would yet do great things. This feeling was shared by
Dale, and by every officer and man on the Bon Homme
Richard.</p>
<p>Several prizes were taken, but within a week the extraordinary
temper of Captain Landais manifested itself.
On the 21st of August it fell calm; the squadron was then
off Cape Clear, and was motionless on the still and glassy
sea. The sun was sinking redly. In full view lay a fine
brigantine, her sails hanging limp in the perfectly still
August air. Paul Jones at once gave orders to hoist out
the boats, and, putting Lieutenant Dale in charge of the
expedition, they pulled off to capture the brigantine.</p>
<p>In the clear atmosphere everything could be plainly
seen on the surface of the water, and Paul Jones could
almost hear, in the perfect silence of the fast waning afternoon,
the orders of his favorite lieutenant, who hailed the
brigantine and demanded her surrender. There was, of
course, no resistance to be made to armed boats, and in a
very short time a hawser was passed aboard, and the men
started to tow the captured vessel to where the Bon
Homme Richard lay.</p>
<p>The twilight had come on fast, and the flood tide was
rising. The Bon Homme Richard begun to drift dangerously
near the Skelligs, that are among the most dangerous
rocks on the wild Irish coast. It became necessary to
tow the ship, so as to keep her head to the tide, and the
commodore&rsquo;s barge, being the only large boat on board,
was hoisted out, with a tow line to keep the ship off the
rocks.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>Danny Dixon, being a strong boy, and many of the
crew being absent, was in the barge. It grew dark
rapidly, and in the dusk the barge looked like a black
shadow ahead of the ship, as the men bent slowly to their
oars, just enough to hold the ship against the tide. Suddenly
Lieutenant Dale, who had the deck, noticed that
the ship&rsquo;s head was wearing round. At the same moment
he heard a splash in the water. The boat, however,
was still pulling ahead, but much faster than it had
been.</p>
<p>For a moment he was puzzled at this, but he called
out in a moment, &ldquo;Avast, there! the line has parted!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boat, however, paid no attention to his cry, but
continued to pull away faster and faster. It dawned
upon him then that the line had been cut purposely, and
he shouted the louder, &ldquo;Return to the ship at once!&rdquo;
He had seen a shadow upon the water, and a continual
splash after the first one, and in a moment or two he saw
Danny Dixon&rsquo;s tow head just under the ship&rsquo;s quarter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me a line, please, sir,&rdquo; called Danny, and the
next moment he was landed on deck dripping wet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve stole the barge, sir,&rdquo; he gasped out, sputtering,
&ldquo;and run away, some o&rsquo; the Portygees and Malays&mdash;there
warn&rsquo;t no &rsquo;Mericans among &rsquo;em. They wanted me
to go along, but I jest slipped overboard and swam for
the ship, and here I is.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>Angry and indignant as Dale felt at the conduct of the
barge&rsquo;s crew, Danny&rsquo;s matter-of-fact way of telling of his
loyalty both pleased and amused him. He said hastily
to Danny, &ldquo;Go below and report to the captain,&rdquo; and
without waiting for orders, the only boat left on the ship
was manned, and, with Mr. Lunt in command, put briskly
after the deserters. Lieutenant Dale also brought one of
the ship&rsquo;s long twelves to bear on the retreating boat and
fired several shots, but both the barge and her pursuers
were soon lost in the increasing darkness. In a little
while the other boats reached the ship towing the brigantine.
The vessel proving stanch and her cargo valuable,
Paul Jones threw a prize crew on her and sent her to
L&rsquo;Orient.</p>
<p>As the night wore on a dense white fog descended
upon the ocean, and the calm continued. There was no
sign of Mr. Lunt&rsquo;s boat. The Bon Homme Richard fired
signal guns all night, and all the next day, as the fog
showed no sign of lifting. The Cerf was sent in the
morning to reconnoiter the coast for the missing boat.
The same degree of cowardice or insanity appeared to
possess the cutter as the Alliance. She was seen by the
boat and would have been rejoined, but, the Cerf hoisting
British colors, and firing at the unfortunate boat, Mr.
Lunt was forced to run ashore, when he and all his boat&rsquo;s
crew were captured. Thus did the commodore lose the
services of one of his best officers and two boats full of
men, amounting to twenty-four in all.</p>
<p>The morning after the boat was lost the captain&rsquo;s gig
of the Alliance was seen at the side of the Bon Homme
Richard. In a few minutes the tall and imposing figure
of Captain Landais appeared upon the ship. Paul Jones
was on deck at the time, and, advancing to greet Captain
Landais courteously, he was struck by the savage scowl
upon the Frenchman&rsquo;s countenance. The general repute
of Captain Landais&rsquo;s ungovernable temper and Paul
Jones&rsquo;s previous experience made him prefer to see the
captain in the cabin. He invited a French marine officer
on board, M. de Chamillard, and an American army officer,
Colonel Weibert, who had volunteered to serve on the
Bon Homme Richard, to accompany him and hear what
passed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>As soon as they reached the cabin, Landais, throwing
his glove violently on the table, exclaimed in English,
&ldquo;So you have lost your boats!&rdquo; This he immediately repeated
in French for De Chamillard&rsquo;s benefit, who did not
understand English.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; asked Paul Jones calmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That you have lost your boats&mdash;and this comes of
attacking a brigantine with boats.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But my boats were not lost while attacking the brigantine,&rdquo;
replied Paul Jones, thinking that Landais was
under a mistake. &ldquo;My barge was cut adrift while towing
the ship, and the deserters absconded. The brigantine
was captured.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet I was not allowed to cruise on my own responsibility
upon this coast!&rdquo; shouted the captain.</p>
<p>Something in the wild gleam of his eye gave Paul
Jones the calmness to reason with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know the Irish coast?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; shouted Landais, excitedly, &ldquo;but I was willing&mdash;I
and my brave officers&mdash;to risk it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I was not willing to risk a ship under my command,
with a captain who is entirely ignorant of this
coast, the most dangerous one I know,&rdquo; replied Paul
Jones.</p>
<p>All this time De Chamillard and Weibert sat amazed
spectators of the scene. Paul Jones&rsquo;s swarthy skin had
turned a shade darker. A kind of lambent flame shone
in his dark, inscrutable eyes. He strongly suspected a
taint of madness in the infuriated man before him, and
was careful not to exasperate him unnecessarily. Landais
continued translating his insubordinate language into
French, and looking at De Chamillard. But the French
marine officer looked steadily away, blushing for the
language of his superior. Again Landais burst out violently:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>&ldquo;But you lost your boats through the folly of attacking
with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is an untruth,&rdquo; answered Paul Jones, rising. His
manner was still composed, but his eyes were blazing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you hear that, gentlemen?&rdquo; shouted Landais furiously,
in French; and turning to De Chamillard, &ldquo;He has
given me the lie direct.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Paul Jones then said coolly, &ldquo;M. de Landais, your
boat is ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words were calm, but even the half-mad Landais
was recalled to his senses by them. Paul Jones fixed his
dark eyes on him. Slowly, yet inevitably, the expression
of Landais&rsquo;s face changed, he sank into a sullen silence,
and then abruptly walked out of the cabin.</p>
<p>Paul Jones turned to De Chamillard and Weibert in
deep agitation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, gentlemen,&rdquo; he said in French, &ldquo;what I
have patiently endured for the sake of the great cause
in which we are all engaged. M. de Landais was in
my power, and you see how merciful I have been to
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we will remember it,&rdquo; answered De Chamillard,
also much moved.</p>
<p>The Bon Homme Richard remained on and off the
coast until the 26th of August, hoping to find the missing
boat, but at last was forced to give it up, and steered for
the northward. The Cerf had never reappeared, so the
squadron was reduced to the Bon Homme Richard, the
Alliance, the Pallas, and the Vengeance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>On the morning of the 27th of August, when Paul
Jones came on deck at daybreak and swept the horizon
with his glass, the Alliance was not in sight, nor did
she turn up any more until the 31st, when her appearance
proved most inopportune, as it always seemed to be during
the memorable cruise.</p>
<p>The Bon Homme Richard was then off Cape Wrath,
and was chasing an armed vessel&mdash;the Union, of twenty-two
guns. The American cruiser was flying British
colors, hoping by that means to get very near before her
nationality was discovered, so that if the Union had any
valuable dispatches (which were often carried by fast
letter-of-marque vessels) there would not be time or opportunity
to destroy them. But as soon as Landais got
near enough to the Bon Homme Richard, although he
must have known that the commodore for some purpose
did not desire American colors to be shown, the Alliance
set two American ensigns. That was warning enough to
the Union. She, indeed, carried important dispatches
from the home Government addressed to the authorities
at Quebec, and upon seeing the Alliance hoist her ensign
knew what to do.</p>
<p>When the British captain was brought on board the
Bon Homme Richard, his first remark to Paul Jones, as
he handed out his papers, was:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had letters containing important information, but
the warning so kindly given me by the frigate yonder enabled
me to destroy them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Paul Jones ground his teeth with rage. He was
tempted for the twentieth time to put Captain Landais
under arrest, but a mistaken clemency induced him to
forbear.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>On the 4th of September the commodore signaled all
the captains to come on board the Bon Homme Richard.
In a little while boats were seen coming from the Pallas
and the Vengeance, but none from the Alliance. Seeing
no motion toward Captain Landais obeying orders, although
the signal had been flying for half an hour, M.
Mease, the purser of the Bon Homme Richard and a
Frenchman, asked for a boat without saying what he
wished to do. It was granted, and the purser went on
board the Alliance and implored Captain Landais to save
himself and his ship the disgrace of a disobedience of
orders. Captain Landais appeared inclined to yield at
first, but finally refused. M. Mease returned to the Bon
Homme Richard, and, thinking that some other of the
captain&rsquo;s countrymen might have better luck, persuaded
De Chamillard and the captain of the Pallas (Cottineau) to
return with him. They went and found Landais on his
quarter-deck. He had worked himself into a passion, and
as they approached he roared at them:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell your Commodore Jones that we must have a
meeting on shore, and one or the other of us must die. I
will not longer bear his tyranny!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three officers looked at each other significantly.
First Captain Cottineau spoke soothingly, but it had no
effect upon Landais. Then De Chamillard tried to reason
with him, but to no effect. M. Mease was not suffered to
speak at all by the infuriated captain. As the officers
passed along the deck to take their boat they noticed the
sullen looks and mutinous air of the men, who firmly believed
that they had either a traitor or a madman for a
commander.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>When they returned on board the Bon Homme Richard
and reported to Paul Jones, he heard them through
patiently. De Chamillard then declared that he believed
Landais was crazy&mdash;that his language and countenance
were wild and his conduct utterly irrational. To this
Captain Cottineau disagreed. He was furiously angry
with Landais, and thought him treacherous. Between
these opposing views Paul Jones concluded to wait and
have a personal interview with Landais. Within a few
hours, however, the wind rose to a terrible gale, and
the Alliance again disappeared, not to be seen until she
made her appearance in a manner as unlooked for as
usual.</p>
<p>Some days of alternate storm and fog followed. Paul
Jones knew that he was off the Scottish coast, but not
until the evening of the 13th of September was it clear
enough for him to see the blue line of the Cheviot Hills
in the distance.</p>
<p>Being in want of provisions and water, Paul Jones in
the middle of the night sent an armed boat to bring off
some sheep and oxen that were seen near the shore. Lieutenant
Dale was in charge of the boat, and had with him
money to pay for the cattle and sheep. This he did, allowing
the owners a generous amount. He managed to
extract a good deal of information from the peasantry,
who told him of the capture of Mr. Lunt&rsquo;s boat, and that
the nature of the expedition was well known, as well as
the fact that Paul Jones was in command, and that no less
than eleven men-of-war were scouring the seas for the
audacious Bon Homme Richard.</p>
<p>Upon their return to the ship Lieutenant Dale reported
to the commodore. When he spoke of the eleven British
captains, each one of whom was eagerly in search of the
honor of capturing Paul Jones, a faint smile passed over
the somewhat sad face of the commodore. England, the
mistress of the seas, put forth all her strength and skill
against this bold intruder into her very strongholds. But
he was not to become her captive, but her continued defiance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>The coasts of England, Scotland, and Ireland were in
an uproar by this time. Signal fires blazed on every hill,
and expresses were sent to London announcing the danger.
But Paul Jones knew he was in no danger from
the shore, and he trusted to himself to take care of
his ship at sea. Never since the days of the sea kings
had any seaman so struck terror into his enemies as
Paul Jones.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER IX.</span></h2>
<p>On the 14th of September Commodore Jones sent for
the captains of the Pallas and Vengeance, and confided to
them a plan he had for laying the city of Edinburgh under
a contribution of two hundred thousand pounds, besides
capturing an armed ship of twenty guns and three
fine cutters that lay in Leith roads.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ships lie in a state of perfect indolence and security,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;which will prove their ruin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The French captains were not at first equal to this
bold project. During one whole night, while the squadron
lay off the Frith of Forth, did Paul Jones argue with
them, and at last their consent was won.</p>
<p>When it was submitted to the younger officers, all received
it with ardor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If these captains had but the dash and enterprise of
their juniors anything could be attempted,&rdquo; remarked
Paul Jones to Lieutenant Dale. Dale shrugged his
shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The French have lost more ships through prudence
than the British through rashness,&rdquo; was his significant
answer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>Paul Jones then made every preparation for the descent.
De Chamillard, who had proved himself a brave and
resolute man, was to take the terms of capitulation and
ransom to the magistrates of Edinburgh. One half hour
exactly was to be given them to provide two hundred
thousand pounds or its equivalent. The gallant young
Dale was to command the landing party.</p>
<p>The Frith of Forth was then entered, and on the 15th
of September the ships were seen distinctly beating up
the Frith. The alarm was general among the inhabitants,
who knew the mighty name of Paul Jones, and who prepared
as well as they could to meet him. Batteries were
erected, and the citizens were served with arms from
Edinburgh Castle. A little boy, ten years old, who was
in Edinburgh then, well remembered the alarm and commotion,
and often spoke of it afterward. This was Walter
Scott.</p>
<p>One man, however&mdash;a member of Parliament&mdash;took it
into his head that the Bon Homme Richard was a British
cruiser, whose mission was to destroy the daring American.
He therefore sent a boat with a messenger, asking
that some powder and shot be sent him so that he might
defend himself against the notorious Paul Jones. The
commodore received the messenger politely on the quarter-deck,
with several officers around him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell your master,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that I send the powder
very cheerfully&mdash;Mr. Dale, will you have a barrel hoisted
out?&mdash;and regret that I have no shot suitable for this
powder.&rdquo; As the powder was of no use without the shot
the member of Parliament was no better off with it than
without it. Nevertheless, the messenger did not have
wit enough to see that he was being gulled, and accepted
the barrel very thankfully. The men on deck, who saw
through the ruse, grinned broadly while they were very
zealous in getting the powder over the side. Bill Green,
however, who had been talking with the men in the boat,
touched his cap and spoke aside to Paul Jones:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you please, sir, that &rsquo;ere duck-legged chap, he&rsquo;s a
pilot, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad you told me,&rdquo; answered Paul Jones: and,
approaching the man, he said carelessly: &ldquo;My fine fellow,
I shall be on and off this coast looking for Paul Jones for
some days, and I shall want a pilot, so I think I shall have
to keep you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, sir,&rdquo; answered the man, touching his cap;
and, calling out to his mates in the boat, he cried: &ldquo;Tell
Ailsa I have got a job of piloting, and she need not expect
me till she sees me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This man proved to be of great service in piloting the
vessel; for, even after her character was discovered, he
was forced to direct her, as his own life, as much as that
of anybody&rsquo;s on the ship, depended upon her safety.</p>
<p>The Bon Homme Richard, with her two consorts, the
Pallas and the Vengeance, continued working to windward
up the Frith until Sunday, the 17th of September,
a gusty autumn morning. Then they were almost within
cannon shot of the town. The boats were hoisted out,
De Chamillard with his soldiers were ready, and Dale,
the youngest lieutenant on board, but the one most after
Paul Jones&rsquo;s own heart, was just about to step over the
side. The wind had been fresh since the dawn of day,
but suddenly a black and furious squall was seen upon
the water ahead of them. The men were ordered in from
the boats to assist in shortening sail, which was barely
done before the squall struck them. The gale increasing
fearfully, the boats were hoisted in, and the vessels were
obliged to bear up before the wind in order to save their
spars. The gale continuing, they were driven out of the
Frith, and had to seek the open sea for safety.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>Toward night the wind moderated. The North Sea
was full of merchant ships, and the Bon Homme Richard,
as well as the Pallas, cruised back and forth, taking and
sinking a number of colliers. This, however, was not the
sort of enterprise that suited Paul Jones&rsquo;s daring spirit.
He proposed several adventurous plans to the French
captains, but could not win their co-operation. They
were brave men, but more prudent than enterprising, and
they had not the personal knowledge of Paul Jones&rsquo;s
powers and resource to take the risks he proposed. There
was a large fleet of merchant ships lying in the Humber,
which Paul Jones wished to entice into the open roads.
The Bon Homme Richard went off before the wind, and
returned wearing British colors, hoping that a certain
ship which carried a pendant at her masthead was a ship
of war, and would fight. This ship, though, kept to the
windward and near dangerous shoals, so that the Bon
Homme Richard could not approach with safety.</p>
<p>In order to learn some news of what was being done
in the way of preparations to meet him, Paul Jones boldly
hoisted a signal for a pilot. Two pilot boats, supposing
the Bon Homme Richard to be a British cruiser, responded.
There was great eagerness between the pilot
boats as to which should be taken on board. Lieutenant
Dale, under Paul Jones&rsquo;s orders, took them both on board,
in order to learn everything possible about the state of
affairs along the coast. Presently Paul Jones, in his undress
uniform, which greatly resembled the British uniform,
except that he wore a Scotch bonnet of blue cloth
bound with gold, strolled along the deck, and, seeing
young Dale in conversation with the pilots, joined him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you heard anything of Paul Jones and his ship,
my good man?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; responded both pilots in a breath, and one
of them continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That &rsquo;ere ship yonder,&rdquo; pointing to the vessel wearing
a pendant, and which was still near the entrance to the
Humber River, &ldquo;she is a armed merchantman&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>&ldquo;And,&rdquo; broke in the other, anxious to contribute his
quota, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a king&rsquo;s frigate layin&rsquo; at anchor up the
river, a-waitin&rsquo; for news o&rsquo; that impudent rebel ship o&rsquo;
Paul Jones&rsquo;s to take her and sink her. I piloted the
frigate in, and they&rsquo;ve give us a private signal for all ships
while the rebel ship is in these waters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That signal would be useful to us,&rdquo; remarked Paul
Jones, smiling in spite of himself. &ldquo;We have not been in
port since early in August, and we might get in trouble
through not knowing the signal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pilots, still supposing the Bon Homme Richard
to be a British ship, gave the signal. Having got all he
wanted out of them, Paul Jones dismissed them with
money, saying that as there was already a frigate in the
river he would continue to cruise outside. As the pilots
went over the side, Bill Green bawled at them:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thankee for that &rsquo;ere private signal!&rdquo; And a roar
of laughter from the foks&rsquo;l showed the sailors&rsquo; appreciation
of the joke. But the pilots went off well satisfied
with their fee and perfectly unsuspicious.</p>
<p>As soon as the pilot boat was out of sight, Bill Green,
under Dale&rsquo;s orders, hoisted the private signal, and lay
near the mouth of the river. The armed vessel came a
little way down the stream, but something aroused her
suspicions, and she put back hastily. The entrance to
the Humber being very difficult and dangerous, Paul
Jones concluded not to attempt it, but to cruise around
Flamborough Head, in the hope of rejoining his consorts,
the Pallas and the Vengeance, and also with the hope of
intercepting the Baltic fleet, which was due about that
time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>This was the night of the 22d of September, the turning
point in the career of Paul Jones, and it was one of
the most miserable nights he had ever spent in all his adventurous
life. The time of his cruise was now up, and
upon joining the other two ships it would be his duty to
proceed to the Texel, after a fruitless and inglorious expedition.
After having endured all the agony of hope
deferred, of suspense and almost of despair for fifteen
months, he had at last got to sea in a miserable old hulk
that was only a travesty on the fair frigate that he had
hoped to command. He had lost one of his best officers
and twenty-three of his men. More than half his squadron
had deserted him, and he had been humiliated by the
insubordination of a French captain that he could not properly
punish without incurring the displeasure of the only
ally that his distressed and struggling country could claim.
He had taken a few prizes, most of which had been lost
by caprice or folly, and he was now about to return to
bear all the shame of failure, for to Paul Jones&rsquo;s lofty
and comprehensive mind the lack of brilliant success was
failure.</p>
<p>A spirit of fierce unrest seemed to possess him as
he walked the quarter-deck of the Bon Homme Richard
while the twilight fell on that September evening. The
darkness came on fast, and with it a fresh but fickle wind.
The moon was near its full, and as it rose from the water
it cast a pale and spectral glare over the vast expanse of
the North Sea. Clouds were scudding wildly across the
sky, and occasionally the moon was obscured for long
periods. It was one of those ghastly nights when misfortune
and sorrow and disappointment seem to brood
over the universe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>The Bon Homme Richard was under easy canvas, and
the crew were sitting around the foks&rsquo;l after their day&rsquo;s
work was done, listening to yarns and songs. Presently,
in the stillness of the September night, Paul Jones heard
Bill Green&rsquo;s rich voice singing. Scarcely knowing why
he did it, so heavy was the weight upon his heart, Paul
Jones walked quietly along the deck, and, leaning over
the rail, unobserved by the men, he listened to the song.
It was sad enough, and the air had a melancholy beauty
in it that went to his very soul. It struck him with the
deadly chill of a presentiment. The men, too, listened
with a subdued and silent attention. This was the song:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t5"><i>Call the watch! Call the watch!</i></p>
<p class="t"><i>Ho! the starboard watch, ahoy!</i> Have you heard</p>
<p class="t0">How a noble ship, so trim, like our own, my hearties, here,</p>
<p class="t">All scudding &rsquo;fore the gale, disappeared</p>
<p class="t0">When yon southern billows rolled o&rsquo;er their bed so green and clear?</p>
<p class="t"><i>Hold the reel! Keep her full! Hold the reel!</i></p>
<p class="t0">How she flew athwart the spray, as, shipmates, we do now,</p>
<p class="t">Till her twice a hundred fearless hearts of steel</p>
<p class="t0">Felt the whirlwind lift its waters aft and plunge her downward bow!</p>
<p class="t10"><i>Bear a hand!</i></p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t"><i>Strike to&rsquo;gallants! Mind your helm! Jump aloft!</i></p>
<p class="t0">&rsquo;Twas such a night as this, my lads, a rakish bark was drowned,</p>
<p class="t">When demons foul, that whisper seamen oft,</p>
<p class="t0">Scooped a tomb amid the flashing surge that never shall be found.</p>
<p class="t"><i>Square the yards! A double reef! Hark! the blast!</i></p>
<p class="t0">Oh, fiercely has it fallen on the war-ship of the brave!</p>

<p class="t10"><i>Bear a hand!</i></p>
</div>
<p>A solemn silence followed as the last musical note
died away on the waters. The waves and the lightly
whistling wind had made a soft accompaniment for the
sweet, sad music. Paul Jones listened to every word,
and at the last &ldquo;<i>Bear a hand!</i>&rdquo; something like a groan
burst from him. Hope had almost gone&mdash;despair was
near to him. He stepped noiselessly from his place at
the rail, and with bent head and folded arms began again
to walk the quarter-deck. Dale, watching Paul Jones&rsquo;s
slight but sinewy figure as he walked up and down like
a caged tiger, noticed the new expression on his face&mdash;an
expression almost of hopelessness. Well might Paul
Jones be hopeless, if this was to be the barren result of
a cruise in which he had promised himself and those
under him so much glory.</p>
<p>All the early hours of the night this ceaseless walk
continued. It was Dale&rsquo;s watch on deck, and he was
relieved at midnight by Cutting Lunt, the only other
sea lieutenant on the ship since Henry Lunt&rsquo;s loss in the
boat. Although not given to following the commodore
unless invited, Dale looked after him wistfully as he went
below. Once within the cabin, Paul Jones threw himself
in a chair, and, resting his head on his hands, gave way to
a silent paroxysm of despair. He knew not how long he
sat in this agony of thought and feeling, but at last, raising
his head, he saw his cabin boy, Danny Dixon, crouched
in a corner, sound asleep. Although Danny&rsquo;s orders were
to leave the cabin and go to his hammock at ten o&rsquo;clock,
he was often found in the cabin at midnight, for which
he always made the excuse that he had fallen asleep and
did not know when it was six bells.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>Something in the boy&rsquo;s faithful and doglike attachment
appealed to Paul Jones at this moment of supreme
distress. &ldquo;Poor little fellow!&rdquo; he thought to himself,
gazing at the boy&rsquo;s sleeping figure. &ldquo;There is one faithful
soul who loves me, poor and unlettered and simple as
he may be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He then rose, and, going forward, laid the boy&rsquo;s head
in a more comfortable position and threw a blanket over
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him rest; he will lie there until morning. And
what would not I give for his sound and careless sleep!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few moments later a slight tap was heard at the
cabin door, and Paul Jones himself opened it. There
stood young Dale. His eyes dropped before the calm
gaze of the commodore&rsquo;s. He had come, led by an impulse
of pity and veneration, but he knew not how to
express it. In a moment or two Paul Jones spoke:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dale, I know why you have come. You feel for me
in my misfortunes&mdash;for surely misfortune has followed
this cruise. Know you, though, that while I want no
man&rsquo;s insulting pity, yours, which comes from the heart,
is sweet to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this he laid his hand on the young lieutenant&rsquo;s
shoulder, and Dale, glancing up, his own eyes full of tears,
saw that Paul Jones&rsquo;s eyes were moist.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know, sir, better than anybody, the trials, the disadvantages,
the insults you have been subject to. But
there is not a man on this ship who does not believe in
you and know that, if we have no captured ship of war
to bring back with us, it is fate&mdash;not want of enterprise.
But, commodore, I have a strange presentiment. I feel
yet that within twenty-four hours we shall have some
glorious event upon our hands. Something tells me that
we are at a turning point, and that Fortune, which favors
the brave, has yet a glorious reward for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May you be right!&rdquo; answered Paul Jones, with a
melancholy smile.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER X.</span></h2>
<p>At daybreak on the morning of the memorable 23d
of September Paul Jones appeared on the Bon Homme
Richard&rsquo;s deck. A short distance off lay the Pallas and
the treacherous Alliance, which the Bon Homme Richard
had chased during the latter part of the night, mistaking
her for a British frigate.</p>
<p>All three ships were now off Flamborough Head. The
day came clear and bright, with a gentle wind from the
south. The delicate chill of the early dawn crept over
the waters, and the eastern sky was aflame with yellow
and pink and purple lights. A rosy mist enveloped the
bold headland, and the waves that eagerly lapped it
caught the crimson glow. The somber North Sea shimmered
with a thousand hues, in the golden glory of the
morning. Afar off, the castled height of Scarborough
shone white in the radiant light, and the milky sails of
fishing boats flecked the blue sea. There were no vessels
in sight except the two French ships, for the name of
Paul Jones kept the merchant fleets hugging the shore
except under convoy. Something in the lovely scene
inspired Paul Jones with renewed hope. As Dale went
up and greeted him on the quarter-deck, Paul Jones said
cheerfully: &ldquo;Dale, I believe you are right. We have
one more day before us, in which we may immortalize
ourselves; therefore I take heart.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>The men were piped to breakfast at six o&rsquo;clock, and
just as they came on deck afterward a brigantine was
observed, apparently hove to far to windward. Chase
was given, and it was plain that she could not escape.
About noon, however, as Paul Jones, with Dale by his
side, was watching the pursuit of the brigantine, they
happened to turn their eyes at the same moment toward
the rocky promontory of Flamborough Head. Just
weathering the headland, they saw a large, white ship,
sailing beautifully, the wind filling her snowy canvas.
There was nothing remarkable in her appearance, but
something prophetic seemed to strike both Paul Jones
and Dale. Their eyes met with a meaning look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said Dale, &ldquo;that ship&mdash;that ship&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is the first ship of the Baltic fleet,&rdquo; replied Paul
Jones in a low, intense voice. &ldquo;I feel it, I know it; and
there must be more than one war-ship giving convoy to
the fleet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next moment, though, it became necessary to
order a boat out to capture the brigantine, which was
now at their mercy. Sixteen of the best hands on board
the Bon Homme Richard were told off for this duty, and
put under the command of Lieutenant Lunt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look out for my signals, Mr. Lunt,&rdquo; were Paul
Jones&rsquo;s last orders, &ldquo;for I expect to fight this day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Every eye on the Bon Homme Richard was fixed on
the ship that had glided so beautifully around the promontory.
Within ten minutes another sail, and another,
appeared in the wake of the large ship, all rounding the
point. Paul Jones, in a passion of suppressed excitement,
seized Dale by the arm. &ldquo;Look!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;It is the
Baltic fleet! It is not less than forty sail, and their convoy,
I have heard, is the Serapis frigate, commanded by
Captain Pearson, and the sloop of war Countess of Scarborough.
Ah, Dale, well may your presentiment come
true! This is our day to fight! Call the bugler, set the
signal for a general chase, and prepare for action; and
we will fight at close quarters.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>Dale fairly rushed off to give the necessary orders.
The men sprang into the rigging with cheers, and set
the fore and main sail. As soon as they were at quarters,
the men, two by two, gave nine cheers for Commodore
Paul Jones. Paul Jones, with sparkling eyes, took off his
cap and waved it.</p>
<p>Just then Bill Green ran across Danny Dixon, who was
hanging over the side, gazing at the stately ships as they
came swiftly around the point, like a flock of huge swans.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, boy,&rdquo; said Bill, &ldquo;you&rsquo;d better be gittin&rsquo; that
sawdust and sprinklin&rsquo; the deck, to keep your spirits up&mdash;&rsquo;cause
I see flunk in your eye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Mr. Green,&rdquo; answered Danny, who had a long
score of practical jokes and chaff to pay off, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be careful
and throw a plenty o&rsquo; sawdust around the wheel to
soak up your blood in case you is welterin&rsquo; in gore, and
I&rsquo;ll be proud to take your last messages to your afflicted
widder&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go along with you!&rdquo; bawled Bill, who was not
pleased with these grewsome suggestions. &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t got no
afflicted widder, nor no afflicted wife neither, you billy-be-hanged
imp! I don&rsquo;t see what boys is made for no-how,
excep&rsquo; to be tormentin&rsquo; and aggerawatin&rsquo;! Maybe
you ain&rsquo;t heerd, youngster, that the British Government
has put a price on your head, and the man that carries
you, livin&rsquo; or dead, aboard a British ship, gits a pile o&rsquo;
money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;W&rsquo;y, that&rsquo;s very kind and complimentary of the
Britishers,&rdquo; answered Danny, with a knowing grin.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what they done for Cap&rsquo;n Paul Jones, and I&rsquo;m
mighty proud to be rated with him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>&ldquo;Jest wait,&rdquo; answered Bill, &ldquo;till these &rsquo;ere guns gits to
barkin&rsquo; and the spars begins to fly &rsquo;round like straws
when you&rsquo;re threshin&rsquo;, and I&rsquo;m a-thinkin&rsquo; you won&rsquo;t be as
brave as the cap&rsquo;n.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t nobody as brave as the cap&rsquo;n,&rdquo; answered
Danny stoutly, &ldquo;but I ain&rsquo;t a-goin&rsquo; to flunk, Mr. Green,
and I&rsquo;m a-goin&rsquo; to give you a extry handful o&rsquo; sawdust
for to drink up your blood when I begins to lay it on the
deck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It seemed as if the ships that came around Flamborough
Head were of an endless fleet. But as soon as
they caught sight of the black hull of the Bon Homme
Richard to windward of them, waiting in grim expectancy,
with the American ensign flying and preparations
for action going on, they gave her a wide berth. They
also raised the alarm by firing guns, letting fly their to&rsquo;gallant
sheets, tacking together, and making as close inshore
as they dared.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Bon Homme Richard had cleared for
action, sent down her royal yards, the crew were beat to
quarters, and signals were made to the other ships to
form the line of battle. The Pallas, under the brave Cottineau,
obeyed the signals with alacrity. The Vengeance
was ordered to bring back the boat with Lunt and his men
in it, and to enter the men on the unengaged side of the
Bon Homme Richard if the action should be begun, and
then the Vengeance was to attack the convoy. She, however,
disobeyed all of these orders, and never came into
action at all. The Alliance disregarded all orders and
signals, and reconnoitered cautiously. Captain Landais
shouted to the Pallas as she passed, that if the man-of-war
which they knew must convoy such a fleet proved to be
the Serapis, all they would have to do would be to run
away!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>It was now long past noon, and still the end of the line
of merchant ships had not been reached. At last, as the
forty-first vessel rounded the point and took refuge inshore,
a beautiful white frigate with a smart sloop of war
following her appeared. The men on the Bon Homme
Richard had seen a boat putting off from the shore for the
frigate, and they surmised correctly that it was to inform
the British frigate that the American ship was commanded
by Paul Jones. Captain Pearson, of the Serapis, was a
brave man, and was delighted at a chance of a fair and
square fight with the American commodore. As Paul
Jones had instantly recognized the Serapis and knew her
commander, each captain was perfectly well aware whom
he was fighting.</p>
<p>Captain Pearson first prudently and gallantly secured
his convoy by clawing off the land so that he was outside
his ships, and then tacking inshore so as to be between
them and the Bon Homme Richard. The Bon Homme
Richard was now coming down under every sail that
would draw. The Serapis was unmistakably ready to
fight, but she stood out to sea, with the view of drawing
the American ship under the guns of Scarborough Castle.
But Paul Jones was too astute for her, and determined to
wear ship, so as to head the Serapis off. By that time
Bill Green was at the wheel, and a good breeze was blowing,
enabling the ship to man&oelig;uvre easily. Dale was officer
of the deck, and gave the orders, under Paul Jones&rsquo;s
direction, to steer straight for the British frigate, that was
waiting for the Bon Homme Richard under short fighting
canvas.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>The whole afternoon had passed in the previous man&oelig;uvres,
and the early twilight of September had come
before the Bon Homme Richard had shortened sail, and
the two ships were slowly but determinedly approaching
each other for the mortal encounter. The moon had
not yet risen, but the stars were lighted in the deep-blue
sky of night, and in the west a faint opaline glow still
lingered. On the chalky cliffs a moving black mass
showed, where thousands of people had assembled to see
the fight, and far in the distance the frowning masses of
Scarborough Castle loomed up, with myriad lights showing
like sparks in the purple twilight. The strong, white
flame from the lighthouse at Flamborough Head flashed
like a lance of fire over the dark ocean. The silent man&oelig;uvres
of the white-winged ships, the stillness only
broken by the orders given and the &ldquo;Ay, ay, sir!&rdquo; of the
sailors, which echoed beautifully over the water, made the
ships seem almost like a phantom fleet. The battle lanterns
were lighted, and every preparation was made for a
fight to the death. The Bon Homme Richard was short-handed
not only for men but for officers, and Richard Dale
was the only sea lieutenant Paul Jones had in the unequal
fight before him. The men were stripped to their shirts,
except Bill Green and a few others, Bill alleging that
&ldquo;&rsquo;Twarn&rsquo;t wuth while to take off a man&rsquo;s jacket till he
got warmed up with fightin&rsquo;!&rdquo; Danny Dixon, as usual,
had discarded his jacket early in the day, and had made
every preparation for a hand-to-hand fight, although, as
he was only a powder monkey, it was not likely that he
would have any fighting at all to do.</p>
<p>It was Danny&rsquo;s place, though, with another boy, to
sprinkle sawdust along the decks to keep them from becoming
slippery with blood. As he got to the wheel,
where Bill Green stood, he threw the sawdust around
liberally, and, although he dared not address the quartermaster,
he remarked in a sly whisper to the other boy:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Green, him and me is pertickler friends, so I&rsquo;m
a-goin&rsquo; to give him a extry handful o&rsquo; sawdust to soak
up his blood, that&rsquo;ll likely be a foot deep round about
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drat the boy!&rdquo; growled Bill under his breath.</p>
<p>It was now about seven o&rsquo;clock in the evening, and
the ships were steadily closing. Paul Jones, night glass
in hand, walked the quarter-deck. The Alliance and the
Vengeance lay off two miles to windward, perfectly inactive,
and apparently meant to be mere spectators of the
great fight on hand. Their indifference and disobedience
to the signals infuriated the officers and men of the Bon
Homme Richard, but Paul Jones took it with the utmost
coolness and composure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let them do as they like,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;the greater glory
ours if we win without them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Cottineau, of the Pallas, on seeing the Bon
Homme Richard change her course and wear, rashly concluded
that the crew had mutinied, had killed the commodore,
and were running away with the ship. It is a
singular instance of the faith which his associates had in
Paul Jones, that Captain Cottineau should have been convinced
of Paul Jones&rsquo;s death before the command of the
ship could be taken from him.</p>
<p>The captain of the Pallas therefore hauled by the
wind and tacked, laying his head off shore. He did not
follow the Bon Homme Richard, until, seeing her begin
the action, he knew that Paul Jones still lived and commanded.</p>
<p>The ships were now within two cables&rsquo; length of each
other. Paul Jones then tacked, in order to cross the bow
of the Serapis. At this moment he perceived a man, at
the order of Captain Pearson, fastening the Union Jack to
the mizzen peak.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; said Paul Jones to Dale, &ldquo;they are nailing
the flag to the mast. There is no need to nail mine, for
the first man that dares to touch it will never breathe
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Serapis was within pistol shot and to windward,
and both ships were on the port tack. The Serapis hailed
as follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is his Majesty&rsquo;s ship Serapis, forty-four guns.
What ship is that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stacy, the acting sailing master, answered the hail
after Paul Jones&rsquo;s directions, who wished to get in a raking
position on the bow of the Serapis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t hear what you say,&rdquo; was the reply through
the trumpet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What ship is that?&rdquo; was again called out from the
Serapis. &ldquo;Answer immediately, or I shall be under the
necessity of firing into you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this, Richard Dale, who commanded the gun deck,
cried to his men, &ldquo;Blow your matches, boys!&rdquo; and in
another instant the Bon Homme Richard thundered out
her broadside. So promptly was this returned from the
Serapis that both reports seemed almost simultaneous.
The roar was tremendous, and echoed and re-echoed over
the sea and from the chalky cliffs.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic5">
<img src="images/p_109.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="792" />
<p class="caption"><i>At the first discharge two of the guns burst.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>In an instant both ships were enveloped in smoke and
utter darkness. By this time the Bon Homme Richard&rsquo;s
bow was just across the forefoot of the Serapis. In order
to keep the wind and to deaden her way, the Bon Homme
Richard&rsquo;s topsails were backed, and she passed slowly
ahead of the Serapis, taking the wind out of her sails.
The Serapis was a short ship, and answered her helm
beautifully, in contrast to the lumbering Bon Homme
Richard. As soon as the wind reached him again, Captain
Pearson, keeping his luff, came up on the weather
quarter of the Bon Homme Richard, fairly taking the
wind out of the American ship&rsquo;s sails in turn. The Serapis
let fly her starboard batteries, and the Bon Homme
Richard replied with her port batteries; but at the very
first discharge of the six eighteen-pound guns on the Bon
Homme Richard, the pieces being old and defective, two
of them burst with a terrific concussion, tearing out the
main deck above them and killing nearly all of the guns&rsquo;
crews that served them. As soon as the shock subsided,
although the shrieks and groans of the wounded still resounded,
Paul Jones ran to the companion ladder and
saw Dale, with a pale but undaunted face, standing on
the shattered gun deck, surrounded by wounded men and
the awful <i>d&eacute;bris</i> of the exploded guns. Most of the ship&rsquo;s
lanterns had been put out by the concussion, and there
was only a dim light that struggled with the darkness.
The moonlight streamed in through the portholes clouded
by the smoke from the Serapis&rsquo;s guns, which thundered
incessantly, hulling the Bon Homme Richard at every
round.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two of the guns are gone, sir,&rdquo; Dale said coolly,
&ldquo;and some of our brave boys. But we will fight the
other four guns as long as they will hold together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a man after my own heart!&rdquo; cried Paul
Jones, &ldquo;and every gun on this ship will be fought as
long as they will hold together; and if we go down, it
will be with our ensign flying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the midst of the smoke and confusion Dale then saw
Danny Dixon running about picking up a row of cartridges
that he had just laid down for the use of the guns,
and which a stray spark might have ignited.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>&ldquo;Right for you, boy!&rdquo; cried Dale; and then, turning
to the men at the other four eighteen-pounders, he ordered
the guns examined. Two of them were cracked
from the muzzle down. This was a terrible blow to the
Bon Homme Richard, as the loss of this battery would
leave only thirty-two twelve-pound guns to fight fifty
eighteen-pounders; for, although the Serapis was classed
as a forty-four, she really carried fifty guns.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Dale, I&rsquo;ve got a good crew here as ain&rsquo;t afeerd
o&rsquo; nothin&rsquo;,&rdquo; said one of the gun captains, seeing that Dale
hesitated to give the order to load and fire, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll resk
it with these &rsquo;ere two eighteens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An instant later both of them were fired, and, as soon
as the smoke drifted off, Dale, speechless with dismay,
pointed to the two guns. Both of them were defective,
and there was no possibility of firing them again; the
only wonder had been that they had not exploded as the
first two did.</p>
<p>The gun captain, sent by Dale, went up to the commodore
on deck, where he stood calmly giving orders that
were distinctly heard above the uproar, and man&oelig;uvring
his ship with the same coolness as if he were working her
into a friendly roadstead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said the man, touching his cap, &ldquo;Mr. Dale says
as how not another shot can be fired from the eighteen-pounders.
They is cracked from breech to muzzle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew it,&rdquo; answered Paul Jones; &ldquo;the instant the
firing stopped, I knew it was impossible to fire another
shot, for Dale would never have given it up as long as he
could work his guns. Tell Mr. Dale I think the enemy
will soon silence the smaller guns, and that if the ship
should catch fire&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a-fire, sir, in a dozen places&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or should leak badly&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The water, sir, is pourin&rsquo; in by the hogshead through
the holes in the hull&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To fight both the fire and the water, and to keep her
afloat as long as possible; and as long as she floats she
shall be fought.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>The men on deck heard these gallant words, and a
rousing cheer rang out over the furious din of the cannonade.</p>
<p>Just at that moment a new enemy appeared. The
Countess of Scarborough, that had been gradually drawing
within gunshot, delayed by the wind, which had become
light and baffling, now suddenly loomed up in the
faint moonlight on the lee bow of the Bon Homme Richard,
and made her presence known by pouring a raking
broadside into the American ship. But seeing, through
the shattered sides of the ship, the blaze and smoke which
Dale and his men were fighting as stubbornly as Paul
Jones was fighting the British, and noticing that nearly
every gun on the Bon Homme Richard was silenced, the
sloop of war drew off, to let, as it was mistakenly thought,
the Serapis finish up the unequal fight. The Alliance lay
off, out of gunshot, a picture of beauty in the pale splendor
of the night, but apparently without any intention of
taking part in the fight. The Countess of Scarborough
turned her attention toward the cowardly ship, which
finally began to return the cannonade the Countess of
Scarborough opened upon her. The Pallas, though, as
if stung by the conduct of her consort, steered for the
Countess of Scarborough, and engaged her with great
spirit.</p>
<p>De Chamillard had held the poop of the Bon Homme
Richard with twenty marines, but after losing several of
his men he was driven back step by step. Paul Jones
watched the brave Frenchman; and if he felt agony at
the defeat that threatened him on every hand he gave no
sign of it, but said to De Chamillard, as he came up,
grimed with powder, &ldquo;See, the Pallas is making amends,
like yourself, for the treachery of the Alliance.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>The slaughter on the decks of the Bon Homme Richard
was frightful, and below she was both leaking and
burning. Moreover, there were over a hundred prisoners
on board, that might be liberated by the fire and the
water. But Paul Jones had in young Dale a man like
himself, and he felt sure that Dale was no more likely to
lose heart than himself.</p>
<p>The steady and uninterrupted broadside of the Serapis
had now silenced every gun on the Bon Homme Richard,
except two small nine-pounders on the spar deck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there&rsquo;s another gun on the quarter-deck, my
lads,&rdquo; cried Paul Jones, &ldquo;and she&rsquo;s not so big we can&rsquo;t
haul her over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this the men rallied with a cheer, and as quick as
thought the gun was dragged across the deck, Paul Jones
himself helping.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now we will make play on her mainmast, boys,&rdquo;
said he, and, pointing the gun himself, a shot whizzed out
and struck the Serapis&rsquo;s mainmast, fair and square. Her
rigging had caught fire, and the masts, being painted
white, were plainly visible against the background of fire
and smoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A good shot!&rdquo; shouted the men.</p>
<p>The shot had not been large enough to shatter the
great spar, but half a dozen others following caused it to
weaken plainly.</p>
<p>And so, with three nine-pounders against the twenty
great guns and thirty small ones of the Serapis, Paul
Jones maintained the honor of the American flag, and
gave no sign of surrender.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>The American tops, though, were well served, and Paul
Jones saw that the decks of the Serapis were being swept
by the musketry fire of the Bon Homme Richard, which
was but little injured aloft, although her hull was almost
a wreck. He could see on the deck of the Serapis the
tall figure of Captain Pearson, and, although men were
falling at every moment around him, he seemed to possess
a charmed life. Besides small arms, the Americans in
the Bon Homme Richard&rsquo;s tops had hand grenades,
which they threw on the Serapis&rsquo;s decks with unerring
aim. But, although the decks were swept, the frigate&rsquo;s
batteries were uninjured, her hull was sound, and she
worked beautifully in the light breeze that blew fitfully.
Meaning, therefore, to rake the Bon Homme Richard,
she worked slowly past, keeping her luff, intending to fall
broadside off and cross the Bon Homme Richard&rsquo;s forefoot.
But there was not sea room enough, and the Serapis,
answering her helm perfectly, came up to the wind
again, to keep from fouling her adversary. This movement
brought the ships in line, and, the Serapis losing
headway, the Bon Homme Richard&rsquo;s jib boom touched
her; so the two ships lay for a minute in this singular
position, where neither could fire a gun.</p>
<p>It was then about eight o&rsquo;clock. The moon, which
was rising, passed into a cloud, and a dense mass of sulphurous
smoke enveloped both ships. Not a gun was
fired for several minutes, and a strange and awful silence
suddenly followed the frightful uproar of battle.</p>
<p>In the midst of the darkness and silence a voice
shouted from the stern of the Serapis:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you surrendered?&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this Paul Jones made that answer which will
always mark him as the bravest of the brave. With his
ship aleak and afire in a dozen places, his guns silenced,
his decks swept by uninjured batteries, his hull riddled,
and a hundred mutinous prisoners ready to spring
from below upon him, he called out in a dauntless
voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t begun to fight yet!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>A tremendous cheer burst from the Americans at this,
and the Serapis perceived that she must destroy her
enemy before she could conquer him. She therefore
managed to swing clear of the Bon Homme Richard,
determined to get in a raking position, either across the
bow or the stern of the ship. Laying her foresail and
fore-topsail aback, and keeping her helm down while she
shivered her after sails, she attempted to wear short
around on her heel. Seeing the Serapis coming down
on him, the Bon Homme Richard drew ahead to lay
athwart her. But in the darkness neither captain could
see very well what he was doing, and both ships came
foul, the jib boom of the Serapis passing in over the Bon
Homme Richard&rsquo;s poop and becoming entangled in the
mizzen rigging.</p>
<p>As soon as Paul Jones saw the Serapis&rsquo;s spar passing
over the poop, he called to the acting sailing master:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Stacy, fetch a hawser immediately, and get
grappling irons!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But as the jib boom of the Serapis touched the mizzen
rigging of the Bon Homme Richard, Paul Jones himself,
without waiting for the hawser, seizing the ropes
that hung to the bowsprit, with his own hand lashed the
two ships together. In another moment Stacy came running
up with a hawser. In the midst of the uproar, the
smoke, the flame, and the confusion, Stacy bungled with
his work, and an oath burst from his lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t swear, Mr. Stacy,&rdquo; said Paul Jones. &ldquo;In another
moment we may all be in eternity, and this is no
time for blaspheming our Maker.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_4" href="#fn_4">[4]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>Stacy glanced at the great man, who could remember
such things at such a moment. The commodore&rsquo;s face
was pale, and a thin stream of blood trickled down the
side of his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Commodore, you are wounded!&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is nothing,&rdquo; answered Paul Jones calmly.</p>
<p>The ships were now made firmly fast, but in the smoke
and darkness it was not perceived on board the Serapis.
Captain Pearson gave orders to drop an anchor under his
bow, thinking his bold adversary would drift away.</p>
<p>The tide was strong, and both wind and tide were in
the same direction, so that the ships drifted rapidly together.
Their spars, spare anchors, and every possible
object became interlocked, and soon the ships were fast
in a mortal embrace. As the Serapis swung round, with
her stern to the bows of the Bon Homme Richard, her
portlids were lowered to prevent the Americans from
boarding her through her ports. The guns were then
fired behind the closed portlids, blowing everything before
them. The British gunners would then have to lean
forward into the shattered sides of the Bon Homme Richard
to pass the rammers in the muzzles of their own guns.
The ships caught fire repeatedly from each other, and so
terrible was the smoke and flame upon the lower decks
of the Bon Homme Richard that the men were forced
above. They assembled on the foks&rsquo;l, where they did
good service with muskets and hand grenades.</p>
<p>The Serapis now appeared to have the Bon Homme
Richard at her mercy. She had completely cleared everything
out on the gun deck, and the fire was rapidly gaining
on the ship in spite of Dale&rsquo;s heroic efforts. On the
spar deck Paul Jones still worked the two or three nine-pounders,
but they were nothing against the tremendous
metal of the British ship.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>But the forcing of the American gunners to the upper
deck enabled them to make it as hot for the British
above as the British made it hot for them below. An
awful fusillade was kept up on the spar deck of the
Serapis, and so terrible was it on the quarter-deck that
the brave Pearson, although remaining himself and giving
his orders coolly, ordered all the men below. So effectually
were the lower-deck batteries of the Serapis worked
that the Bon Homme Richard was cut entirely to pieces
between decks, especially from the mainmast to the stern.
The rudder and stern frame were cut completely off, and
soon the shot began to pass clear through the ship without
finding anything to strike.</p>
<p>The moon was now bright, and the wind having caused
the smoke to drift, Paul Jones perceived the Alliance approaching
to windward. He turned to Dale, who had
come on deck. &ldquo;Thank God,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the battle is
now over! Yonder is the Alliance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Alliance came on under a fair wind, but, to the
consternation of every one on the Bon Homme Richard,
on passing close to leeward she deliberately fired a broadside
into the stern. Immediately every voice on the commodore&rsquo;s
ship was raised:</p>
<p>&ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake,&rdquo; they shouted, &ldquo;stop firing into us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Alliance, though, as she sailed by, fired into the
side and the head of the ship as well as the stern. In
vain were three lanterns shown&mdash;the signal of reconnoissance;
the Alliance paid no attention to the signal, and
her fire dismounted one or two guns, killed and wounded
several men, and cut the ship up aloft a good deal. One
of the men on the Bon Homme Richard yelled:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The crew has mutinied, and they are taking the ship
to the British!&rdquo; This induced several of the faint-hearted
to leave their quarters.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>Not so Danny Dixon; although but a powder boy of
fourteen, he was as cool as any old hand on board. Paul
Jones himself, still bent on carrying the mainmast of the
Serapis, was directing the fire of the little nine-pounder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One more shot,&rdquo; he called, &ldquo;and the mast goes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gunner asked for a wad, but none was at hand.
Danny Dixon, quietly stripping off his shirt, handed it to
the gunner, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This &rsquo;ere shirt off my back&rsquo;ll make a good many
wads.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Paul Jones saw the action and heard the words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, my brave lad,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;I shall not forget this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thankee, sir,&rdquo; answered Danny with sparkling eyes.</p>
<p>The Bon Homme Richard was getting lower and
lower in the water, and at the same time only the most
tremendous exertions kept the fire from reaching the
upper decks. Suddenly the carpenter, the master at
arms and a master gunner came rushing up from below.
They had been down in the hold where the prisoners
were, and working the pumps to keep the water down,
which poured in from shot holes below the water line.
One of the pumps had been shot away, and that had
demoralized these three men. Lieutenant Dale was on
deck, and as the carpenter rushed up, shouting to the
commodore, &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a-sinkin&rsquo;, sir, and we can&rsquo;t do no
more at the pumps!&rdquo; Dale caught the man by the
throat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You abandoned coward, come below with me instantly!
The ship shall not sink!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Paul Jones heard every word, and, coming up quickly
to Dale, said in his ear:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put the prisoners to the pumps. They are doubtless
so terror-stricken that they are at their wits&rsquo; end, and a
determined man like you, Dale, can manage the whole
hundred of them&rdquo;&mdash;for there were not less than a hundred
in the hold.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>Dale was the very man to carry out this audacious
order. He instantly ran below, and, just as Paul Jones
had foreseen, the bold promptness of one determined
officer, armed and resolute, cowed them all. They went
to work at the pumps, when, if they had retained their
senses, they might have stepped on board the Serapis.</p>
<p>In a minute or two more Dale was again on deck, and,
going up to the commodore, said calmly but in a loud
voice, so that the men around could hear him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s not sinking, sir. I have put that coward of a
carpenter to work with an honest man to watch him, and
everything will shortly be right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This very much reassured the men, who had no idea
of the terrible destruction below.</p>
<p>Within a few minutes Danny Dixon came up to the
young lieutenant with a solemn face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Dale, please, sir,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t git no more
powder. The gangway to the powder room is all chock-a-block,
and the sentinels won&rsquo;t let me pass. I ain&rsquo;t afeerd
o&rsquo; the fire, though its blazin&rsquo; pretty close to the magazine.
I ain&rsquo;t afeerd o&rsquo; that, sir, but I can&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before Danny had finished speaking Dale saw a dozen
strange faces crowding up the companion way. In an
instant the truth flashed upon him&mdash;some of the prisoners
had escaped from the hold. Drawing his pistol, he
marched them immediately back, where again they went
to work at the pumps.</p>
<p>Meanwhile numbers of the men were called from their
quarters to put out the fire in the magazine. Upon going
to it, with Danny Dixon following at his heels, Dale
found that the reason the sentinels would not let any one
pass to the magazine was on account of the number of
strange faces, which they, too, knew to be the prisoners,
crowding around, and who might have easily captured
the magazine. But Dale, animated by the spirit of his
commander, with two or three resolute men like himself
kept down both the fire and the water in the hold. As a
matter of fact, the Bon Homme Richard was on fire continuously
almost from the very beginning of the engagement.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic6">

<p class="caption"><i>Battle of the Bonhomme Richard and the Serapis.</i>
<br />The bold headland of Flamborough is seen on the right. The force of the explosion on the <i>Serapis&rsquo;s</i> deck blew the British flag against the wind.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>The mainmast of the Serapis was still being pounded
by the three small guns on the Bon Homme Richard&rsquo;s
deck, which were worked under the eye of Paul Jones.
Sometimes he himself took a part in the handling and
pointing of the guns, and his indomitable coolness seemed
communicated to the men. The spar deck of the Serapis
was still pretty effectually cleared, but she was unbeaten
below. The gun captain, though, who had come up from
below when the great guns burst, now filled a bucket
with hand grenades and climbed into the maintop. The
main yard of the Bon Homme Richard lay directly over
the main hatch of the Serapis. He then lay out on the
main yard, until he got to the sheet block, where he
fastened his bucket. Then, with perfect deliberation and
unerring aim, he began to throw his grenades at the open
hatchway. Every one went straight, and every one exploded.
Paul Jones, who was on the poop, called out to
him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you could get one down on the gun deck, where
there is no doubt some loose powder about&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m arter, sir,&rdquo; responded the sailor
coolly, and within two minutes one had rolled down the
hatchway and had dropped upon a row of cartridges.
An instant and terrific explosion followed. It seemed as
if the whole interior of the ship had been blown out.
Every gun was silenced, and an awful stillness prevailed
for a moment or two. Just then the gunner, who had
been below, ran up on the Bon Homme Richard&rsquo;s deck,
and, terrified out of his life, cried, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see the commodore!&rdquo;
and running, aft, he intended to strike the
colors. The ensign had been shot away, however, and
was dragging in the water; the man therefore yelled for
&ldquo;Quarter! quarter!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Scarcely were the words out of his mouth when he
saw a figure at his side, and felt a stunning blow from a
pistol&rsquo;s butt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you see the commodore now?&rdquo; cried Paul Jones;
&ldquo;and let me not hear any man on this ship beg, like a cur,
for quarter!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cry for quarter had been heard on the Serapis, and
Captain Pearson called out in the half darkness:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you ask for quarter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, by heaven!&rdquo; shouted Paul Jones. &ldquo;We will
give quarter, but we never ask it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>About this time one of the prisoners stepped through
the side of the Bon Homme Richard into the Serapis, and
reported the desperate condition of the American ship.
Immediately the bugler on the Serapis sounded the call
for boarders, and a number of them, armed with pikes
and cutlasses, appeared at the bulwarks. But Paul Jones,
seizing a boarding pike, stood in the gangway to receive
them. It never occurred to the boarders that there was
not a large body to repel them, besides the sailors on
deck, and they retired. But it is a fact that no man
touched a pike except Paul Jones.</p>
<p>It was now about half past ten o&rsquo;clock. The pallid
moon showed the whole dreadful scene. The Pallas,
which had very gallantly made the Countess of Scarborough
haul down her colors, had her hands full transferring
the prisoners from the British ship. As the Alliance,
which had been sailing around the combatants and
had fired another broadside into the Bon Homme Richard,
passed the Pallas, Captain Cottineau begged Landais
to go to the assistance of the gallant Bon Homme
Richard.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>Captain Landais did indeed approach the Bon Homme
Richard, but it was only to fire one last broadside, that
did as much harm to the American as to the British ship.
After that he hauled off and did no more damage.</p>
<p>Then the mainmast of the Serapis began to totter, and
it was seen that it must soon go by the board. The small
nine-pounders, worked under Paul Jones&rsquo;s own eye, the
shower of skillfully thrown hand grenades, and the sharpshooters
in the Bon Homme Richard&rsquo;s tops, made the
deck of the Serapis so hot that scarcely a man dared
show himself. On the quarter-deck especially was this
so; and the brave Pearson, while keeping his place coolly,
ordered the men forward, and remained the only man
upon the quarter-deck of his ship.</p>
<p>The Bon Homme Richard now managed to bring one
or two more guns to bear, although her hull was almost
destroyed by the Serapis. Both ships were in a desperate
case, but Paul Jones was no nearer surrender than he
was at the beginning of the fight. Pearson, though, realized
that he was in the last extremity, and then, and then
only, with his own hand he managed to lower the flag he
had caused to be nailed to the mast. His action was visible
by the light of the full moon, and the lanterns that
made blazing points of flame all over the two warrior
ships in spite of the drifting clouds of black smoke.</p>
<p>Paul Jones&rsquo;s first order was:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cease firing!&rdquo; and his next words were, &ldquo;Where is
Dale?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, sir!&rdquo; cried Dale, coming up. The young lieutenant&rsquo;s
face was blackened with powder, his epaulet was
gone, and he was deathly pale with suppressed excitement.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>&ldquo;Go immediately on board that ship with such men
as you may need, and bring off her captain and her ensign,&rdquo;
said Paul Jones.</p>
<p>There was no occasion for a bridge between the two
fast-locked and burning ships. Dale ran to the gangway,
and with one bound landed on the bloody deck of the
Serapis.</p>
<p>Although the fire of the Bon Homme Richard had
ceased, those upon the lower decks of the Serapis did not
know that the colors had been struck, and they kept up
their cannonade through the riddled hull of the Bon
Homme Richard. The smoke still drifted in a sulphurous
mass, but Dale at once distinguished Captain Pearson&rsquo;s
tall figure, as he stood calmly, with folded arms, on
the quarter-deck. Going up to him, Dale removed his
cap and said respectfully:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, I am directed to bring you on board the Bon
Homme Richard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Pearson inclined his head silently and stepped
forward.</p>
<p>Scarcely were the words out of Dale&rsquo;s mouth when
the first lieutenant of the Serapis came up from below.
Advancing eagerly, he said to his captain:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have the rebels struck, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Pearson uttered no word, but looked into the
lieutenant&rsquo;s eyes with an expression of agony.</p>
<p>Then Dale spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;<i>You</i> have struck, and this ship is
our prize.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lieutenant, rudely ignoring Dale, again asked the
captain:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, have they struck?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For answer, the brave Pearson covered his face with
his hands. The lieutenant, turning on his heel, said:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p>&ldquo;I have nothing more to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dale then remarked quietly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will proceed on board the Bon Homme Richard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you will permit me to go below, I will silence the
firing on the lower deck,&rdquo; said the lieutenant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; replied Dale firmly.</p>
<p>By that time the Bon Homme Richard&rsquo;s men had
swarmed over the side, and some of the British sailors
and officers, running up from below and not knowing that
the ship had struck, dashed upon the Americans, and several
blows were exchanged. The officers, though, on
both sides quelled the <i>m&ecirc;l&eacute;e</i> and the British sailors then
quietly submitted. But another row, worse than the
first, was likely to be precipitated by Danny Dixon. He
marched up to one of the Serapis&rsquo;s cabin boys, who was
about twice as big as himself, and who was armed with
the cabin broom as the most available weapon he could
find at short notice. Getting close up, Danny bawled at
him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are my prisoner!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Serapis boy looked with undisguised contempt at
Danny, and for answer said sulkily:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go along with you. I ain&rsquo;t none o&rsquo; your prisoner.
I&rsquo;m took by that pirate Paul Jones, I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before the words were well out of his mouth Danny
hauled off and hit the boy a resounding slap in the face.
The boy promptly responded by knocking Danny down
with his broom.</p>
<p>Just then Bill Green, who had been relieved for a few
moments from the wheel, appeared at Danny&rsquo;s side, and,
collaring him with one hand as Danny scrambled up,
while with the other he seized the cabin boy&rsquo;s neckerchief,
Bill gave them both a powerful shaking.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<p>&ldquo;If you two chaps don&rsquo;t behave yourselves,&rdquo; he shouted,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll report you both, and I&rsquo;ll give you a private wallopin&rsquo;
o&rsquo; my own besides. That&rsquo;s the wust o&rsquo; boys&mdash;they never
knows how to behave theirselves. D&rsquo;ye see Cap&rsquo;n Paul
Jones and the British cap&rsquo;n a-maulin&rsquo; and a-poundin&rsquo; each
other? And don&rsquo;t you know prisoners ought to be treated
kind? That&rsquo;s why the officers sets a example to the men
and to the wuthless, triflin&rsquo;, good-for-nothin&rsquo; boys!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;B&mdash;but, Mr. Green,&rdquo; said Danny, struggling to get
his breath in Bill&rsquo;s brawny grasp, &ldquo;he said as the commodore
were a pirate, and that&rsquo;s for why I hit him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did, did he?&rdquo; snorted Bill, highly incensed, and
letting Danny go, while he devoted both hands to the
unlucky cabin boy. &ldquo;Then I wish you&rsquo;d &rsquo;a&rsquo; hit him twice
as hard; and if it warn&rsquo;t for them officers over yonder,&rdquo;
he yelled to the Serapis boy, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d give you sech a keel
haulin&rsquo; as nobody but a Dutchman never had afore.
You say Cap&rsquo;n Paul Jones is a pirate, do yer?&rdquo; Here
he lifted the boy completely off his feet, while a well-directed
kick emphasized his remarks. &ldquo;Now, you take
that back, or by the almighty Joshua, I&rsquo;ll heave you overboard!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy, scared out of his life, sputtered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I take it back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill then turned to Danny, and said, excitedly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You oughter git some smart money for that &rsquo;ere lick
he give you, and I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to see as the commodore
knows about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Mr. Green,&rdquo; said Danny, slyly, &ldquo;you said as we
was to imitate the cap&rsquo;ns, and not be maulin&rsquo; and poundin&rsquo;
each other&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say no sech a thing,&rdquo; answered Bill, angrily;
&ldquo;I said, as if anybody was to say Cap&rsquo;n Paul Jones were
a pirate you was to knock his eyes down into his shoes,
and not to leave a whole bone in his skin. That&rsquo;s what I
said, boy, and you misunderstood me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dale now accompanied the British captain politely to
the gangway, where not even a plank was necessary to
step on board the Bon Homme Richard. As the young
lieutenant glanced up and saw Paul Jones waiting to receive
his distinguished prisoners, he saw a red stream
had trickled down the side of the commodore&rsquo;s head, and
one of his epaulets was soaked with blood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My captain, you are wounded!&rdquo; cried Dale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is but a trifle,&rdquo; quickly replied Paul Jones. Captain
Pearson at that moment stepped upon the Bon
Homme Richard&rsquo;s deck. He silently unbuckled his
sword and handed it to Paul Jones, who received it with
one hand, and immediately returned it with the other,
saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I return it to you, sir, because you have bravely used
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other British officers and men were then passed
rapidly aboard the Bon Homme Richard. The Americans,
as if they had only then realized the magnitude of
their victory, suddenly stopped work at the pumps, at
fighting the fire, and at the usual preparations for taking
possession of a ship, and, as one man, they gave three
thundering cheers. Paul Jones, taking off his cap, listened
to this heroic music with ineffable thoughts crowding
upon his mind. The moon was now at the full, and
blazed upon the dark bosom of the water with solemn
grandeur. Afar off rose the white cliffs off England,
while nearer, but still far, were the black hulls and shadowy
spars of the Alliance, the gallant Pallas, and the
conquered Countess of Scarborough. The air was yet
full of the smell of burned powder and smoldering wood.
Across the still and blue-black sea they could see the
lights of Flamborough Head and Scarborough Castle
like star points in the sky.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>Paul Jones was roused from the strange mood of triumph,
and of sadness too, by a frightful crash which resounded
through both ships.</p>
<p>The tottering mainmast of the Serapis gave one
mighty lurch, and then fell over the side, striking with
a sound like thunder. A deep and terrible silence followed
for a moment, and even the exultant cheering of
the Americans, which had not quite ceased, was stilled.
There was something overwhelming in the sight of the
brave and lovely Serapis, that only a few hours before
had sailed proudly and defiantly in her beauty and freedom,
now beaten, dismasted, and her colors struck. But
this one short moment of solemnity was followed by
another burst of cheers, and all the fierce commotion of
a victorious ship.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XI.</span></h2>
<p>The first thing to be done on board the Bon Homme
Richard was to attempt to check the fire. The ceilings
had caught, and were burning slowly but determinedly.
The fire having got within a few inches of the powder
magazine, Paul Jones ordered all the powder brought up
on deck. There were more than a hundred prisoners on
the Bon Homme Richard before the fight, and the men
taken from the Serapis brought the number up to over
five hundred. Those who were not disabled were put to
work at the pumps, where they toiled with the desperate
energy of men struggling for their lives. Paul Jones
himself escorted Captain Pearson to the cabin, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg that you will make yourself as comfortable as
circumstances will admit. You will have the consolation
of knowing that no man ever made a better defense of his
ship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Pearson bowed, and answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your conduct is most generous&mdash;&rdquo; and hesitated, as
if to express surprise at such good treatment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will find, I hope, that all American officers are
generous in victory; and should we have the misfortune
to be forced to haul down our colors, I trust that we
would show the fortitude of the brave who are unfortunate,&rdquo;
said Paul Jones, with dignity&mdash;and, with a low bow,
he retired from the cabin, leaving Captain Pearson alone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>As soon as the commodore returned to the deck he
ordered the lashings to be cut, as the ships continued to
catch fire from each other, and there was great danger to
the powder on both.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And both ships must be saved, my lads!&rdquo; cried he
to the men, who were working like Trojans to save the
Serapis from the flames.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay, sir,&rdquo; answered the men heartily.</p>
<p>As soon as they were free, the Bon Homme Richard
drifted rapidly off. The Serapis was hailed and ordered
to follow.</p>
<p>On board the Serapis Dale was in command. Exhausted
by his five hours of work and fighting, he sat
down on a dismounted gun near the binnacle. The reaction
had come. A profound sadness seized him, and
he could almost have wept when he saw the destruction
around him. But nothing made him forget his duty for
a moment. As soon as the ships parted he ordered the
wreck of the mainmast to be cleared away, the headyards
braced aback, and the helm put hard down. This was
promptly done, but still the ship did not pay off. Imagining
that her steering gear was cut to pieces, he ordered it
examined, but, to his surprise, found it uninjured. Puzzled
by so strange a state of things, Dale jumped from his
seat, only to fall his length upon the deck. Bill Green
ran to him and helped him up; but Dale could not stand
upon his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And natural you can&rsquo;t, sir, seein&rsquo; as your ankle is
wounded,&rdquo; said Bill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it?&rdquo; answered Dale, faintly. &ldquo;I did not know until
this moment I was hurt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then the pilot boat containing Lieutenant Lunt
and sixteen men hailed the ship alongside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For Heaven&rsquo;s sake, Lunt, come aboard!&rdquo; cried Dale;
&ldquo;your services are needed here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>As Lunt came over the side the sailing master of the
Serapis appeared, and, going up to Dale, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, the ship can&rsquo;t pay off, because she has an anchor
under foot.&rdquo; This was the anchor dropped by Captain
Pearson when the ships first fouled. The cable was cut,
and the ship instantly answered the helm. She was
much cut up aloft, but her hull was sound, and she had
no water in her. Preparations were at once made to repair
her. A jury mast was rigged in place of the mainmast,
and new sails were bent instead of those that had
been torn to pieces by hand grenades exploded in her
rigging.</p>
<p>The night was now far spent. The moon, that had
shone so brilliantly during the fury of the battle, now
hung low in the misty night sky that glimmered with a
pale and waning light. A white fog was creeping slowly
in from the Atlantic, and a fitful wind ruffled the black and
phosphorescent water.</p>
<p>The first thing to be attended to, while the carpenters
were at work upon the crippled Serapis and the almost
wrecked Bon Homme Richard, was the care of the
wounded and the burial of the dead. As there was great
doubt whether the Bon Homme Richard could be kept
afloat until daylight, no wounded were removed from the
Serapis, where the British surgeons attended to them.
Her dead also were buried from her deck, one of the
British lieutenants reading the service of the Established
Church, in an agitated voice. On board the Bon Homme
Richard, Paul Jones, as he always did, read the Psalms
for the dead over the brave men who had fallen around
him. Everything was done quickly, but with proper
reverence, for, no matter how much encompassed by danger
Paul Jones was, he never forgot to give fitting burial
to the departed brave. Like all men of feeling heart and
deep imagination, Paul Jones, after the inspiration of
battle and the glory of victory, always felt a keen distress
at the ruin and desolation it wrought. The sight
of the gallant men cold in death, that lay in rows upon
the reeking deck of the Bon Homme Richard, covered
by the flag whose honor they had so gloriously maintained,
wrung his heart and filled his eyes with tears.
And this man, who had dared death from battle, fire, and
water rather than strike his flag, faltered and almost
wept as he read the solemn words of the Psalmist before
the dead were laid at rest in the ocean.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>As each body fell swiftly and silently overboard a
heavy blow seemed struck upon the heart of Paul Jones.
The officers and men crowded the deck, standing with
uncovered heads, while a little way off the Serapis
loomed up in the fast rising mist, and from her side a frequent
dull splash showed that the same solemn ceremony
was taking place upon her decks.</p>
<p>At last it was over. The men with a sudden alacrity
folded up the flags, quickly carried the grewsome planks
and canvas below, and the boatswain&rsquo;s pipe sounded
cheerily calling the men to work.</p>
<p>The reaction from the burial of the dead at such a
time is always great, and the officers and men vie in their
quick rebound to cheerfulness. Paul Jones felt this instant
and magnetic change. Ten minutes from the time
that the last sad ceremonies were over he walked the
deck with his usual graceful and alert step, ordering,
overlooking, and encouraging everybody.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>Meanwhile a boat had pulled off from the Serapis,
and when Paul Jones, who had gone below for a moment
to see how the carpenters were getting on, came upon
deck, Dale was being helped over the side. Paul Jones
went immediately up to him. Dale leaned heavily upon
a sailor, and Paul Jones at once saw that his favorite lieutenant
was lame.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My lieutenant, you are wounded!&rdquo; he cried; and
Dale, at hearing the very words he had addressed to the
commodore, smiled faintly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; he answered; &ldquo;I did not know it until a
little while ago. I don&rsquo;t know when I was hurt, or how,
but I was forced to give up the command to Mr. Lunt
and return to you. But how is your wound?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is nothing&mdash;nothing!&rdquo; cried Paul Jones, but really,
although his wound in the head was not dangerous, he
had lost much blood, and only his indomitable will kept
him upon his feet.</p>
<p>Wretched indeed was the plight of the brave Bon
Homme Richard. Immortalized she was, but she had
given her life for her victory. So desperate was her
condition between decks that many of the sailors, regarding
her as a floating coffin, sprang overboard and swam
to the still stanch Serapis, and to the Alliance, that now
appeared off the weather quarter of the gallant ship she
had so treacherously deserted.</p>
<p>It was now nearly daylight, but the fog enveloped
everything, and the eye could scarcely penetrate a hundred
yards. A wind still blew fitfully, driving the fog
hither and thither, but as fast as it was drifted landward
another great fog bank would come rolling sullenly in
from the open Atlantic. It deadened the sounds of the saw
and the hammer and the constant creaking of the pumps
as the men toiled at them. Once it almost lifted. It was
just at sunrise, and a great golden lance seemed to penetrate
it straight from heaven. Like magic, the white
mist parted, the sky, the sea, and the air were suddenly
flooded with a rose-pink glow, and the fair and lovely
light shone full upon the lithe figure of Paul Jones as he
stood on the poop with his face turned to the east. His
arms were folded, and his inscrutable dark eyes, full of a
strange rapture, were uplifted to the sky. Glory was the
breath of his life, and here was glory enough for a lifetime,
as he saw his own shattered ship, and the Serapis
conquered but still majestic.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>For five minutes he stood motionless. He was recalling
the same hour the day before, and now his proudest
wish was fulfilled. Alone and single-handed he had
beaten an enemy at least twice as strong as himself. He
had made the name of the American navy respected from
thenceforward, and his far-seeing mind realized the mighty
effect of his victory. After a while he roused himself
from his reverie, which was a sort of exaltation, and swept
the horizon with his glass. Not a sail was in sight where
twenty-four hours before they had whitened the seas
around him. The very name of Paul Jones had frightened
them into harbor.</p>
<p>But soon the fog descended again, and Paul Jones devoted
himself to one intense and long-continued effort to
save the smoldering, leaking, but glorious Bon Homme
Richard. It was his ardent wish to save his ship, the
eloquent witness of his prowess, and to that work he
turned with almost superhuman energy. The dim morning
wore on. The men were mostly below, fighting
the leaks and the fire, and the decks were comparatively
deserted, when Paul Jones, still on the poop, caught
sight of Danny Dixon running aft as hard as he could
clip it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on!&rdquo; cried Paul Jones. &ldquo;There is work for
everybody on this ship. Why are you idle?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t idle, sir,&rdquo; answered Danny, touching his cap.
&ldquo;The flag as was most shot to pieces is hangin&rsquo; astern
now, under water; and I thought, sir, as you wouldn&rsquo;t
want to lose that &rsquo;ere flag, I&rsquo;d git it out o&rsquo; the water for
the honor o&rsquo; the ship, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right; go and get it,&rdquo; answered Paul Jones,
smiling.</p>
<p>Danny disappeared astern, and presently came up
dripping. But he had the torn flag, and was wringing
it out as he came along.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here she is, sir,&rdquo; said he, as Paul Jones took it; &ldquo;and
here&rsquo;s a little rag o&rsquo; it, sir, that I hopes you&rsquo;ll let me keep
in my ditty box.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He showed a scrap a few inches square that he had
torn from the shattered flagstaff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you may,&rdquo; replied Paul Jones. &ldquo;That is in
place of the shirt you took off and gave for a gunwad. I
see you have another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; answered Danny, who had on a shirt about
twice too big for him. &ldquo;Mr. Green, he flung it to me jist
now. I dunno where he got it from.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the hours passed on the terrible situation of the
Bon Homme Richard became plainer. She was literally
cut to pieces between decks, from her spar deck to the
water line, and there was not planking enough in the
whole squadron to patch her up. The wind also began
to rise, and Paul Jones, remembering that where eleven
British cruisers had been searching for him the day before,
knew that probably fifty would be after him by sundown,
and that he must make his way toward the Texel
as quickly as possible.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>About ten o&rsquo;clock in the morning the fire was at last
out, and Paul Jones called Captain Cottineau, with all the
carpenters in the squadron, on board, to consult with
them as to the possibility of carrying his ship into port,
which he could scarcely bring himself to believe was impossible.
Captain Landais&rsquo;s opinion was not asked, nor
was he suffered to come on board the Bon Homme Richard.
The carpenters examined the ship thoroughly, and
all of them agreed that she could not possibly be made
to last more than a few hours. Such also was Captain
Cottineau&rsquo;s opinion. When it was communicated to Paul
Jones, this man, so insensible to fear, yet felt the loss of
his ship so deeply that tears dropped from his eyes; but
he realized that the ship was now in a hopeless condition,
and that while he might risk his own life further, he could
not risk those of the brave men under him. When once
his mind was made up to the cruel necessity he acted
with characteristic promptness. Immediately all the
boats were pressed into service transferring the wounded
to the captured Serapis. There was but little worth saving
on the Bon Homme Richard, and the Serapis was full
of stores of all sorts. It took the whole day and the following
night to place the wounded and the prisoners on
the Serapis and to repair damages. Even to the last, Paul
Jones could not utterly abandon the hope of saving the
old ship, made forever glorious in that short September
night. He left an officer on board and a gang of men,
who were directed to work the pumps as long as possible.
The boats were in waiting in order to take them off if the
water gained on them too fast. An American ensign was
hoisted, and the officer was directed to leave it flying.
About nine o&rsquo;clock Paul Jones, from the quarter-deck of
the Serapis, saw the signal made for the boats&mdash;the Bon
Homme Richard was sinking. The men were taken off,
and Paul Jones watched her last moments as one watches
by the deathbed of one&rsquo;s best beloved. She sank lower
and lower in the water after she was left, while her ensign
fluttered bravely in the wandering breeze. At last, about
ten o&rsquo;clock, as Paul Jones watched her agonizingly through
his glass, he saw her give a lurch forward. She went
down head foremost, and the last thing seen of her as she
settled into her ocean grave was the mizzen to&rsquo;gallant
mast, and the flag at the peak.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<p>&ldquo;Good-by, brave ship!&rdquo; cried Paul Jones with a deep
sob, as the waters closed over the ship of immortal
memory.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XII.</span></h2>
<p>The wind continued to freshen as the squadron,
with its two prizes, made for the open sea. Bad weather
followed, and for ten days the Serapis, with her make-shift
masts, and the other ships, were tossed about the
angry North Sea. At last, though, the wind proved kind,
and on the morning of the 3d of October anchor was cast
off the island of Texel.</p>
<p>The sight of a splendid British frigate with an American
ensign flying proudly over the Union Jack, and a
twenty-gun sloop of war in the same plight, was an inspiring
sight to the few Americans and friends of the
cause of independence at the Texel. News of the victory
had preceded the arrival of the ships, and it was a matter
of the keenest interest how Holland, a neutral power,
would receive these victorious enemies of England, which
literally ruled the seas. The fact is, the brave and prudent
Hollanders felt deeply sympathetic with the young
republic of the West in her fight against Holland&rsquo;s ancient
maritime enemy; but the court and the court party were
absolutely under British influence, and it was not long in
manifesting its animosity to the flag that Paul Jones carried.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<p>Scarcely were the ships at anchor before news came
that a British line of battle ship was waiting outside of
the Texel. According to the rules of war, the American
ship should have remained long enough to have
what was necessary done for her in the cause of humanity.
The British ambassador, Sir Joseph Yorke, was highly
incensed at the American ship being accorded succor,
and openly and bitterly spoke of Paul Jones as &ldquo;that
pirate.&rdquo; But the &ldquo;pirate,&rdquo; when he went up to Amsterdam
a few days after his arrival, received such an ovation
from the enthusiastic Americans and the brave Dutchmen
as any man on earth might have been proud of.
Huzzas and waving handkerchiefs saluted him from the
French and Americans in Amsterdam, while the Dutchmen
bowed low to him. When he appeared upon the
Exchange, wearing proudly his American uniform and
his Scotch bonnet, edged with gold, the crowds pressed
around him so that he was forced to retire into a room
fronting the public square. The plaudits of the crowd
becoming uproarious, he was obliged to show himself
at the window and bow, after which he hastily retreated.</p>
<p>This reception very much affronted Sir Joseph Yorke,
who, on the 9th of October, wrote to the Dutch Government
demanding that the American ships &ldquo;be stopped,&rdquo;
and declaring Paul Jones to be &ldquo;a rebel and a pirate.&rdquo;
Other measures than writing letters were used to &ldquo;stop&rdquo;
him. The battle ship watching off the Texel had been
joined by eleven other ships of the line and frigates.
Eight were stationed at the north entrance to the harbor,
where they expected Paul Jones would come out, and
four at the south entrance. Here, on every fine day,
they might be seen cruising back and forth. Small
squadrons were also on the lookout for him on the east
coasts of England and Scotland, the coast of Norway, the
Irish Channel, the west coast of Ireland, and in the Straits
of Dover. In all, there were forty-two British ships after
Paul Jones, and two of them were lost while on the watch
for him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>Within the Texel he had powerful enemies in the
British ambassador and the royal court. In spite of
both, though, by courage and firmness he forced the
Dutch authorities to grant him the asylum that the
laws of civilized warfare give to ships in distress. He
demanded, and was given, leave to establish a hospital
under the American flag on shore for his wounded, to
dispose as he pleased of his five hundred prisoners, and
to have the drawbridges at the fort hauled up whenever
he desired. Thus menaced as Paul Jones was with dangers
outside, he had still many to encounter within the
port. He had great trouble in getting the Serapis refitted,
and then he was told plainly by the French ambassador
that he must accept a French commission and fly the
French flag if he desired to hold on to the ship which was
the noble spoil of his victory; otherwise he must transfer
his flag to the Alliance, a ship in every way inferior to
the Serapis. Landais, it may be said in passing, had
been detached from the ship and ordered to Paris to answer
for his conduct. It was bitter enough to the British
ambassador to see the American colors flying on an
American ship&mdash;the Alliance&mdash;but it was intolerable to
see it over a beautiful British frigate like the Serapis; and
he had influence enough with the Dutch Government to
have this intimation given the French ambassador, who
was obliged to notify Paul Jones.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<p>The Bon Homme Richard had found an ocean grave,
and grievous as this blow was to Paul Jones, more grievous
still was it to give up the lovely Serapis, which, as he
wrote Benjamin Franklin, was the finest ship of her class
he had ever seen. But he did not hesitate a moment.
Never during the battle for independence would he serve
under any except the American flag, or bear any but an
American commission. So, with a sore heart but an unflinching
determination, he gave the Serapis up to his
French allies, and with Dale and his old company of the
Bon Homme Richard he transferred his flag to the Alliance.
But day by day his enemies grew stronger, and
the Dutch yielded more and more to the angry domination
of the British. Every obstacle was put in his way
to prevent the refitting of his ship, while at the same
time he was told that, if he did not go to sea with the
first fair wind, the Dutch fleet of thirteen double-decked
frigates would force him out. And that would be to
force him into the very jaws of destruction, so they
thought, with twelve British ships cruising in full sight.</p>
<p>But, menaced from within and without, the indomitable
spirit of Paul Jones only maintained itself the more
undauntedly. As every morning dawned the American
colors were hoisted at the mizzen peak of the Alliance,
and flew steadily until the sunset gun was fired&mdash;and that
in the face of twenty-three Dutch and British ships, any
one of which was more than a match for the Alliance.</p>
<p>However the officials might treat him, the sympathy
of the people was with Paul Jones and his gallant companions.
The Dutch naval officers paid him marked respect
and attention, although they were ready, at the
word of command, to fire into him. He had other consolations
too. His letters from Franklin were frequent
and affectionate. One of them Paul Jones handed Dale
to read. It said: &ldquo;For some days after the arrival of
your express nothing was talked of except your cool
conduct and persevering bravery during the terrible combat.&rdquo;
And Franklin had sternly denounced Landais, who
was now held in universal contempt.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>The American cause was extremely popular among
the masses in Holland, and the sailors were always well
treated on shore. Whenever Bill Green could get leave,
he usually spent it at a clean and orderly Dutch tavern,
where, surrounded by stolid Dutchmen gravely smoking
their long pipes, Bill would hold forth upon the glories
of the fight with the Serapis. About this time he picked
up a new song, which he brought on board the Alliance,
written out in a fair and clerkly hand, with innumerable
flourishes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose,&rdquo; remarked the boatswain, skeptically, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll
want us to believe as you wrote that out with your own
flipper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes, I did,&rdquo; answered Bill, somewhat sheepishly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; continued the boatswain, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a shame
for you to be nothin&rsquo; but a quartermaster. The purser
hisself, he don&rsquo;t write no such handwritin&rsquo; as that. But
pipe up the song, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill, to avoid awkward discussions, piped up with unusual
promptness, and sang as follows:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Heave the topmast from the board,</p>
<p class="t">And our ship for action clear.</p>
<p class="t0">By the cannon and the sword</p>
<p class="t">We will die or conquer here.</p>
<p class="t0">The foe, of twice our force, nears fast:</p>
<p class="t">To your posts, my faithful tars!</p>
<p class="t">Mind your rigging, guns, and spars,</p>
<p class="t">And defend your Stripes and Stars</p>
<p class="t4">To the last.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;At the captain&rsquo;s bold command</p>

<p class="t0">And resolved he there would stand,</p>

<p class="t0">To defend his flag and ship with his life.</p>
<p class="t">High on every mast displayed,</p>
<p class="t">&lsquo;God, Our Country, and Our Rights.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="t">E&rsquo;en the bravest braver made,</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>The attentions shown Paul Jones personally by the
Dutch naval officers were very displeasing to the British
ambassador, and by intrigue he succeeded in having Captain
Rimersima, who had been very polite to the Americans,
superseded in favor of Vice-Admiral Reynst, as
commander of the Dutch fleet. This vice-admiral belonged
to the court party, and was notoriously unfriendly
to Paul Jones. On the 12th of November he sent Paul
Jones a peremptory order to sail with the first fair wind.
In spite of every effort, the American ship was not yet in
condition to keep the sea. But, for this very reason, the
vice-admiral constantly urged Paul Jones to depart, and
even threatened him in case he did not. At last, on the
28th of November, a positive threat was made. The
vice-admiral wrote that, unless Paul Jones went out, the
Dutch fleet would drive him out. The wind at the time
was contrary. Paul Jones received this message from a
junior Dutch officer on the quarter-deck of the Alliance,
and replied, in a loud, firm voice that not only all the
men on the Alliance could hear, but all the sailors in the
Dutch man-of-war&rsquo;s boat:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The vice-admiral demands impossibilities,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Can any ship get out of the road in such a wind as this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he called up an old Dutch pilot that he had kept
on board for a week past&mdash;Peter Maartens.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maartens,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;will you undertake to carry this
ship out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pilot, a stolid old Dutchman with a great beard,
looked at Paul Jones very solemnly for a long time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not if I keep sober,&rdquo; he answered gravely; at which
even the vice-admiral&rsquo;s junior officer was forced to smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I will have that statement written out, and
you shall sign it,&rdquo; promptly replied Paul Jones.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>The paper was written and read to the pilot, who
signed it in the presence of the Dutch lieutenant. For
ten days they were left unmolested. Sir Joseph Yorke
thought, however, that he had succeeded at last in ruining
Paul Jones, for, forced to put out as soon as the wind
permitted, there was a British squadron waiting for him
at either entrance to the harbor. It seemed as if Paul
Jones was at last destined to be caught. But Fortune
favors the brave&mdash;and she had never yet deserted this
daring sailor. Everything had been done with the insufficient
means at hand to get the Alliance into good condition.
Much of her sailing qualities had been destroyed
by the crazy Landais&rsquo;s method of ballasting. This was
remedied, and the ship was in fairly good order. As
Paul Jones wrote to Franklin: &ldquo;The enemy still keeps a
squadron cruising off here, but this will not prevent my
attempts to depart whenever the wind will permit. I
hope we have recovered the trim of the ship, which was
entirely lost the last cruise; and I do not much fear the
enemy in the long and dark nights of this season. The
ship is well manned, and shall not be given away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>How does the gallant spirit of Paul Jones ring in those
last words!</p>
<p>About the middle of December the Dutch vice-admiral
one day sent word to Paul Jones, desiring him to
come on board the Dutch flagship. To this Paul Jones
sent a polite but determined refusal. As the Dutch boat
pulled off, he said, laughing, to Dale:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does that puppet of kings think that an American
commodore will obey like a dog the orders of a Dutch
admiral?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Failing to get him on board, Vice-Admiral Reynst
wrote him a peremptory note, asking if the Alliance was
to be considered a French or an American vessel. If
French, the captain&rsquo;s commission was to be shown to the
Dutch vice-admiral, the French flag and pendant displayed,
and a gun fired to announce it. If American, the
ship was to leave at the earliest possible moment.</p>
<p>To this Paul Jones replied in these characteristic lines:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="sc">Sir</span>: I have no authority to hoist any colors on this
ship except the American, and whenever the pilot will
take it upon himself to conduct the ship to sea he shall
have my best assistance.</p>
<p><span class="jr"><span class="sc">Paul Jones</span>,</span>
<span class="jr">&ldquo;<i>Commanding the American Continental ship Alliance</i>.&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<h2 id="c14"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XIII.</span></h2>
<p>The officers and men were as anxious to get away
from the inhospitable Texel as was Paul Jones, and the
sight, day after day, of the low-lying, monotonous landscape,
the frozen dikes, and the pale, wintry sky was dreary
enough to them. Dale kept the wardroom in a good
humor, though, and Bill Green spent much of his enforced
leisure, as usual, in learning songs which he claimed to
have composed.</p>
<p>At last, as Christmas approached, it was known on
board that they were ready to sail, and that a day or two
at most would find them at sea. The officers and men
were all on board, and no more shore leave was granted.</p>
<p>The wind was already veering round to the east, and
although they would have to wait for the wind, there
would be no waiting for weather, for the fouler the
weather the fairer the chance of running the gauntlet of
the British fleet, which would then be dispersed, each
ship looking out for herself. Therefore the Americans
prayed for bad weather as ardently as sailors usually
pray for good.</p>
<p>On Christmas night there was great jollification aboard.
Paul Jones dined in the wardroom by invitation of the
officers, and afterward announced to them:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen, in forty-eight hours we shall be at sea,
with our best American ensign flying, and then we can
take care of ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<p>A burst of cheering followed this. The only person
present besides the officers of the ship was the celebrated
Captain Cunningham, who had suffered horrors in an
English prison. Paul Jones had at last succeeded in having
Cunningham exchanged, and was taking him to
France as a passenger.</p>
<p>The jollity aft was quite equaled by the fun forward,
and from the foks&rsquo;l sounds of cheering, laughing, shouting,
and the noisy clatter of feet, as the sailors danced
reels and hornpipes, was plainly audible. Danny Dixon,
who waited behind Paul Jones&rsquo;s chair, when asked what
the noise meant, whispered artfully:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please, sir, Mr. Green he&rsquo;s got a new song, all about
&lsquo;a Yankee ship and a Yankee crew, tally hi ho, you know.&rsquo;
It&rsquo;s a beautiful song.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it?&rdquo; cried Paul Jones, whose spirits rose high at the
prospect of once more taking his ship to sea. &ldquo;Gentlemen,
shall we send for Green to give us a new patriotic
song he has?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; they all exclaimed, &ldquo;a song, by all
means!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Danny therefore was sent after Bill, who was found
trolling forth in his rich baritone to the admiring foks&rsquo;l
people, and occasionally getting up and shaking a leg to
give emphasis to his music.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Green,&rdquo; said Danny, going up to him, &ldquo;you
must report to the cap&rsquo;n immediate for a song. He
knows as how you&rsquo;ve got a good &rsquo;un, and the cap&rsquo;n and
the officers wants to hear it&mdash;that there one about a
Yankee ship and a Yankee crew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sho!&rdquo; said Bill with an affectation of great reluctance,
&ldquo;I knows as you wuthless, tale-bearin&rsquo; lubberly boy
went and told the cap&rsquo;n I had a new song, and I&rsquo;ve a
great mind to give you the cat for it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<p>&ldquo;Lord, Mr. Green, I ain&rsquo;t done no harm,&rdquo; said Danny
apologetically, who understood the case perfectly, and
knew there was no danger of the cat. &ldquo;The cap&rsquo;n knows
you sing grand, and &rsquo;twarn&rsquo;t my fault he axed for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, mates,&rdquo; said Bill, rising with a delighted grin,
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s mighty hard on me havin&rsquo; to leave you. I&rsquo;d ruther
not sing if I could help it, but orders is orders, you know.
Howsomedever, young&rsquo;un,&rdquo; he remarked to Danny, &ldquo;the
very next time you gits me in a singin&rsquo; scrape like this, I&rsquo;m
a-goin&rsquo; to skin you, mind that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; answered Danny very meekly.</p>
<p>The officers were all sitting around the table with
pipes, and full of talk, laughter, and jollity, when Bill
Green&rsquo;s handsome figure and face appeared in the wardroom
door. Bill, as usual, pretended to be quite overcome
with bashfulness, and twiddled his cap modestly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give him a glass of punch to wet his whistle,&rdquo; cried
Paul Jones, and Danny Dixon officiously filled a glass
from the punch bowl and handed it to him.</p>
<p>After gulping down the punch, Bill cleared his throat
and remarked that he &ldquo;had thunk out a little song and
had wrote it out&rdquo;&mdash;Bill forgot that the wardroom officers
knew he could not write a line&mdash;&ldquo;and as the men
got arter him to sing it, he had tried it oncet or twicet,
and he&rsquo;d do his best to pipe it up reg&rsquo;lar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He then began, his rich voice echoing musically
through the low-pitched wardroom. The officers soon
caught the refrain, and whenever it came they accompanied
it with much clinking of glasses, and trolled out
a chorus, Dale leading. This was the song:</p>

</div>
<p>Roars of laughter and applause greeted this, and Bill
was compelled to respond to an encore. The evening
and a part of the night passed in gayety and merriment,
and the sober Dutchmen were much astonished at the
hilarity on the American ship. Paul Jones had had the
ship dressed for Christmas, and the British at the Texel
were obliged to endure the sight of an American flag
flying from every masthead on the Alliance. At last,
two days after Christmas, Peter Maartens, the pilot, was
sent for. The weather was thick, and a tremendous gale
seemed to be rising. When Paul Jones proposed to take
the ship out, Peter shook his head very solemnly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any pilot who takes a ship out in this weather is
likely to lose his license, and I can&rsquo;t risk it,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Peter had rather a weakness for the bottle, although
it was said that he was as good a pilot when he was half
seas over as when he was quite sober. It was Christmas
time, and Peter was liable to yield to temptation. Paul
Jones was therefore not surprised when, as night was
falling, a few hours after, Peter Maartens&rsquo;s boat hailed the
ship, and he announced that he was ready to carry her
out. Immediately the anchor was lifted, and within an
hour the Alliance stood down the river in the teeth of a
northeast gale.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<p>It was a murky December night when, with a strong
wind, the ship started on her way toward the open sea.
A perfectly new American ensign had been run up for
the occasion, and Sir Joseph Yorke had the mortification
of knowing that the ship went boldly out to run the
gauntlet of her enemies, without any disguise whatever.
Dale, as first lieutenant, was on deck. Bill Green was at
the wheel. Peter Maartens&rsquo;s orders, although very judicious,
were not very distinct, as he had been indulging in
the flowing bowl, and the first thing the Alliance knew
she was afoul of a Dutch merchantman. The Alliance
dropped her best bower anchor, in the effort to get clear,
and in the wind, the darkness, and confusion, the cable
parted or was cut by the Dutchman. Peter Maartens
then declared that nobody but the devil himself would
put to sea in such a gale, and flatly refused to carry the
ship out that night. However, he brought her to anchor
so close inshore that in the morning they were forced to
cut the cable themselves in order to get out, thus leaving
both their bower anchor and sheet anchor in the roads of
Texel; but they were out of the Dutch port, or purgatory,
as Paul Jones himself expressed it, and under close-reefed
topsails they were heading for the ocean in the
midst of a roaring gale. But the American ensign flew
as long as they were in sight of land, and until they were
three marine leagues out. The Alliance hugged the shoals
so close, in order to keep to windward of the blockading
British squadrons, that several times they had hard work
in clawing off. At last, however, they were clear.</p>
<p>Paul Jones, wrapped in a cloak and with a sou&rsquo;wester
pulled down over his eyes, called to him Lieutenant Dale,
who had the deck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dale,&rdquo; he said, carelessly, &ldquo;what passage, think you,
shall we take to France?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The northward, I presume, sir,&rdquo; replied Dale, astonished
at the question from his commander.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<p>&ldquo;And do the officers and crew expect we shall go
north, and away from the British Isles?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, sir,&rdquo; replied Dale, still more surprised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Paul Jones, laying his hand on Dale&rsquo;s
shoulder, &ldquo;you may depend upon it, if all my officers and
men expect me to avoid the English Channel, every British
captain that is hunting for me likewise will look for
me to the northward. But I will sail through their channel,
under the very noses of their fleet at Spithead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said Dale, who was a very matter-of-fact young
man, &ldquo;surely nobody will think of hunting for you in the
lion&rsquo;s mouth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Paul Jones at this laughed one of his rare laughs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will go with me willingly into the lion&rsquo;s mouth?&rdquo;
he said; to which Dale replied coolly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In spite of the bad weather the ship made a good run,
and the next day, it being perfectly clear, they passed
boldly through the Straits of Dover, and were in full
sight of the whole magnificent British fleet in the Downs.
They then made the Isle of Wight, which they passed,
and for more than an hour they were within a very short
distance of the fleet assembled at Spithead. The forest
of masts, the huge dark hulls of the ships, the fluttering
ensigns, made a lovely picture in the bright air of December.
What would not one of those brave British captains
have given to know that Paul Jones, the invincible, was
sailing under their very lee!</p>
<p>Paul Jones resorted to his usual ruse. The ports of
the Alliance were closed, her guns covered with spare
sails and tarpaulins, she flew the British ensign, her crew
were kept below, and she presented the appearance
of a smart British merchant ship, or possibly a letter of
marque.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<p>Two days was Paul Jones in the British Channel,
much of the time in sight of the chalk cliffs of England,
and scarcely an hour of the night or day that he was not
in view of the British cruisers, which, as Dale justly said,
did not think it worth while to look for him in the lion&rsquo;s
mouth. He kept well to windward, though, for this man,
so daring in his undertakings, yet carried the details out
with the most consummate prudence.</p>
<p>After getting clear of the channel, and in easy reach
of the French harbors, he cruised about off Cape Finist&egrave;re
for some days. A furious January gale coming up
in the Bay of Biscay, and having but one anchor left,
Paul Jones put into the port of Corunna, in Spain. The
fame of his exploits had preceded him, and he and his
officers received the utmost attention, especially from
some Spanish naval officers there. Paul Jones greatly
admired the Spanish ships, which were sheathed with
copper, and expensively fitted; but, like Nelson, he had
no great faith in the ability of the Spaniards to take care
of their fine ships.</p>
<p>On this cruise the Alliance seems to have been indeed
a stormy petrel, and encountered much bad weather, so
that it was the 10th of February before anchor was cast
in the roads of Groix, before L&rsquo;Orient.</p>
<p>Shouting multitudes received him. Letters of enthusiastic
praise from Franklin and Lafayette and many distinguished
Americans and Frenchmen awaited him, and
he was hailed as the hope of the infant navy of his
country.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<h2 id="c15"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XIV.</span></h2>
<p>The wound in the head which Paul Jones had received,
and which he had made light of, turned out to be
more serious than he would at first acknowledge. He
had had one or two other hurts, of which he had said
nothing, and his labors and the mental strain to which
he had been subjected seriously affected his health and
particularly his eyes. The multitudes that lined the
quays and streets of L&rsquo;Orient to greet him when he
came ashore for the first time, were touched to see that
the great sea warrior&rsquo;s eyes were bound with a white
handkerchief, and he leaned upon the arm of his faithful
Dale. Danny Dixon trotted close behind, and during the
days of Paul Jones&rsquo;s illness and partial blindness the boy
became eyes and hands to him. Paul Jones took a lodging
on shore, leaving the ship in Dale&rsquo;s command, as she
lay in the roads. Every day he walked out for exercise,
Danny following sedately behind him and gazing at him
with a peculiar expression of reverence that often made
Paul Jones smile. But the intensity of the boy&rsquo;s affection
was sweet to him. He spent the early spring months at
L&rsquo;Orient very quietly, trying to regain his health. He
had the society of his faithful young lieutenant, and whenever
he appeared in public he was greeted with the utmost
enthusiasm. Repeated messages were sent him
from the French court to visit Paris; but not until he
felt it necessary, in order to secure his gallant crew their
prize money, did he determine to go. Dale was to be left
in command of the Alliance; Danny Dixon was to go to
wait on the captain, and was overwhelmed with delight
at the idea of seeing the world under such distinguished
auspices.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">137</div>
<p>When Paul Jones went on board the Alliance to say
farewell before leaving for Paris, he received the applause
dearest to him&mdash;that of his officers and crew. The men
were piped aft, and, standing surrounded by his officers,
he made them a short speech. He was still pale, and the
wound in his head was not fully healed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I go to Paris, my men,&rdquo; said Paul Jones, &ldquo;chiefly
to secure the prize money that you have so gloriously
earned. I shall not rest until I have got it for you. I
leave in command my trusty Mr. Dale. Behave to him
as you would to me. You have seen his gallantry in
action, and you will now see his justice and probity in
calmer times. I thank you all&rdquo;&mdash;here Paul Jones&rsquo;s voice
broke, and it was a moment or two before he could proceed.
&ldquo;I thank you all, officers and men, for the courage
that enabled us to capture the Serapis. The victory was
as much yours as mine, and you have the word of Paul
Jones that your just reward shall be secured. I shall
return shortly, and, till then, farewell!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sailors gave Paul Jones not only three cheers, but
three times three, and the officers joined in the cheering
with a will. Dale had been appointed to reply for the
officers, and he stood with moist and glowing eyes as he
spoke:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<p>&ldquo;All that we have acquired of glory is through you.
Can we ever forget that you commanded our ship in the
unequal battle, fought the guns in person, lashed the ships
together with your own hand, took up a pike like the
humblest man on board to repel the enemy when they
would have boarded us, and succeeded against water,
fire, treachery, and valor? As long as ships traverse the
ocean will your name be known; and as long as life lasts
will we esteem it the highest honor that we can claim, to
say, &lsquo;We fought with Paul Jones on the Bon Homme
Richard!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another round of cheers followed this, when Bill
Green was put forth as the spokesman for the men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis said, sir,&rdquo; began Bill, hitching up his trousers
before starting in on his oratorical effort, &ldquo;that there&rsquo;s
two things no sailor-man can do&mdash;one is, to make a speech,
and t&rsquo;other is, to ride a horse. &rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t reasonable as a
sailor could ride a horse, sir, &rsquo;cause horses is ornnateral
beasts, that is always yawin&rsquo; about from side to side, no
matter how straight you lay your course, nor what quarter
the wind is from. But we don&rsquo;t need to make no speech
about our commodore. That &rsquo;ere British ensign we has
got speaks loud enough; them two British ships you took
agin the awfullest odds we ever see&mdash;<i>they</i> speaks; that
gallant ship o&rsquo; ourn, the Bunnum Richard, that went to
the bottom&mdash;<i>that</i> ship speaks; that &rsquo;ere cut acrost your
forehead, sir&mdash;<i>that</i> speaks; and, as for we in the foks&rsquo;l,
give us the name o&rsquo; Paul Jones for our cap&rsquo;n and we kin
wallop anything afloat. The cap&rsquo;n on the S&rsquo;rapis, he
nailed his flag to the mast and then he had to haul it
down. But we don&rsquo;t need for to nail our flag to the mast,
sir, because we all knows that the man who touches that
&rsquo;ere flag is a dead man, if Commodore Paul Jones is commandin&rsquo;.
And so we says, commodore, health and long
life to you! and, as Mr. Dale has said, the proudest thing
we kin ever say is, &lsquo;We fought under Paul Jones on the
Bunnum Richard, sir!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<p>Another tremendous round of cheers followed this.
Paul Jones, with his eyes full of tears, shook hands silently
with each of his officers, and then, with a profound bow to
the men assembled, he stepped to the side. In an instant,
as if by magic, every sailor sprang aloft, and in less time
than it takes to tell it the yards were manned. Two fine
French frigates that lay close by the Alliance also manned
their yards, and thundered out a salute of thirteen guns
to the commodore&rsquo;s broad pennant, which was about to
be hauled down. The Alliance responded with thirteen
guns; and so, amid the applause and cheers of his men,
the thunders of artillery, and all the honors that could be
heaped upon him, Paul Jones left his ship.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">140</div>
<h2 id="c16"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XV.</span></h2>
<p>Within an hour he was on the road to Paris, traveling
by the <i>diligence</i>.</p>
<p>It was his intention to get to Paris as quietly as possible,
and for that reason he wore plain citizen&rsquo;s clothes,
and wrapped himself in a large cloak; but Danny Dixon,
swelling with the importance of the charge of his commander&rsquo;s
portmanteau, had no notion of letting the great
man pass unknown through the world. Danny sat in the
rumble along with a very smart and dapper little valet,
who was accompanying his master, a French officer, to
Paris. As Danny was not by any means as elegant as the
Frenchman, he was subject to much contempt, all of
which he bore with stoical good humor.</p>
<p>The May morning was fresh and beautiful, and as they
dashed along the broad and level road they saw green
fields on each side of them, and comfortable homesteads in
sight, while occasionally a noble chateau reared its towers
in proud seclusion, half hidden by great trees. The trees
were just budding, and when the <i>diligence</i> rolled occasionally
over the moss-grown stone bridges the streams beneath
ran over their pebbly beds with the laughing fullness
of the spring. The air was deliciously soft and fresh,
and as Paul Jones sat on the box seat, inhaling the beauty
and glory around him, he felt a subtile joy and satisfaction
in life. Presently he looked back to see how Danny
was getting on. Danny, with the commodore&rsquo;s portmanteau
tightly clasped between his knees, was looking a
picture of satisfaction.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">141</div>
<p>&ldquo;How do you like this?&rdquo; asked Paul Jones, amused
at the boy&rsquo;s rapt look of enjoyment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fust-rate, sir,&rdquo; answered Danny, touching his cap.
&ldquo;This &rsquo;ere&rsquo;s mightily like being on the topsail yard, sir,
and I think she rolls and pitches a good deal. But maybe
that&rsquo;s because she ain&rsquo;t ballasted right&mdash;all the dunnage
is aft, sir&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here Paul Jones frowned at Danny, which immediately
checked his eloquence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Sacre bleu!</i>&rdquo; said the dandy valet, who was dressed
quite as well as his master, and who spoke what he thought
was English; &ldquo;you talk ze rubbish. Your master, he is
vidout doubt, a man of seafaring, who goes to home with
a hundred louis d&rsquo;or in his plocket&mdash;poket&mdash;pocket&mdash;for
a jollitime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is, is he?&rdquo; answered Danny wrathfully. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
have you to understand, sir, that I serves Commodore
Paul Jones, o&rsquo; the Bunnum Richard, what took the S&rsquo;rapis,
and the Britishers has sent out forty-two ships o&rsquo; the line
and frigates for to ketch him, and they&rsquo;d ruther have him
nor the whole durned French navy, with all your wuthless
admirals throwed in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are von saucy boy,&rdquo; responded the Frenchman
angrily; &ldquo;and as for your Paul Jones, vy, I nevair heard
of ze gentilhomme before!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; replied Danny, very coolly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you
something for to remember the fust time you ever heerd
of him!&rdquo; and, without a moment&rsquo;s warning, he suddenly
caught the little Frenchman by the ankle and by the
collar, and, jerking him off the seat, held him suspended
over the back of the rumble, about five feet from the
ground, while the horses galloped along, the postilions
cracked their whips, and the white road sped beneath
them.</p>
<p>As soon as the Frenchman could get his breath he
bellowed loudly, but he was afraid to struggle lest Danny
should drop him, and he little knew the strength in those
young sinews and strong boyish arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t never heerd o&rsquo; Commodore Paul Jones,&rdquo;
bawled Danny, &ldquo;and you never heerd on the Bunnum
Richard nor the S&rsquo;rapis nuther, but I reckon you&rsquo;ll remember
all about &rsquo;em next time you hear on&rsquo; em!&rdquo; Danny
emphasized these remarks by giving the little Frenchman
several tremendous shakes, which terrified him more than
ever.</p>
<p>The commotion was not heard for a moment or two,
on account of the rattling of the <i>diligence</i> and the rate at
which they were traveling, but as soon as the affair was
noticed cries resounded from the passengers, both to
Danny and to the postilions to check the horses. Just as
Paul Jones turned around and caught sight of Danny
the <i>diligence</i> came to a halt, and, with a final shake, Danny
dropped the Frenchman in the road.</p>
<p>Quite forgetting himself in the surprise and shock of
the occasion, Paul Jones cried out angrily: &ldquo;What are
you doing, sir? Have you lost your mind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; replied Danny, touching his cap again,
&ldquo;but that &rsquo;ere frog-eating landlubber, he had the imperence
for to tell me that he ain&rsquo;t never heerd o&rsquo; you, sir,
nor of the way you took the Drake and the S&rsquo;rapis, nor
the forty-two British cap&rsquo;ns as was on the lookout for you,
sir; so I jest handed him over the side, sir, meanin&rsquo; to hold
him there by the slack o&rsquo; his trousers till he axed for
quarter, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<p>Meanwhile, the Frenchman, sputtering and swearing,
had got up from the ground and was brushing the dust
off his elegant attire. The French officer, his master, at
first disposed to be angry, could not help laughing at
Danny&rsquo;s explanation and the tone in which it was given.
He explained it in French, and everybody shouted with
laughter, except the unfortunate lackey and Paul Jones,
but even Paul Jones could not wholly refrain from smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Behave yourself better in future, sir, and remember
it is I who tell you so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Danny bobbed his head and touched his cap again,
saying, &ldquo;Ay, ay, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the boy&rsquo;s words had turned every eye on Paul
Jones. Was this slight, dark, quiet man the redoubtable
Paul Jones, the terror of the seas, the man that England
put forth all her might to capture, but who was still free,
still great? Paul Jones&rsquo;s dark skin flushed under this
close scrutiny. The French officer, raising his hat, made
a profound bow, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I ask if we have the honor of addressing the
celebrated, the invincible Paul Jones?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your compliments do me too much honor,&rdquo; replied
Paul Jones, &ldquo;but I am the person you have so flatteringly
described.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All hope of privacy was now at an end. Every eye
was fixed on him, and every ear was open to catch his
lightest remark. This was not what Paul Jones desired,
and he inwardly chafed at Danny Dixon&rsquo;s indiscreet devotion
that had betrayed him. But Danny was not the
boy to let the fact remain in obscurity that he served
Paul Jones, and he beamed with delight at the French
officer&rsquo;s words.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">144</div>
<p>The poor valet, having brushed the dust off his clothes,
now climbed back into the rumble, and the <i>diligence</i> proceeded
upon its way. The only word that Danny condescended
to address to him was when they alighted two
days afterward in the streets of Paris.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know now, Mounseer Landlubber, who Commodore
Paul Jones is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Parbleu</i>, yes,&rdquo; sighed the lackey. &ldquo;I vill not forget
ze gentilhomme&mdash;nevair, nevair!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">145</div>
<h2 id="c17"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XVI.</span></h2>
<p>Paul Jones&rsquo;s first visit in Paris was to his best and
firmest friend, Benjamin Franklin. In all of his anxieties,
as well as his triumphs, Franklin had stood unflinchingly
by him; and now, no man rejoiced more at his splendid
fame than Franklin. As soon as it was known that the
immortal Paul Jones was in Paris crowds flocked to see
him, and his modest lodgings were overrun with people
of the greatest distinction. The American cause was
very popular, and the presence of two such men as Benjamin
Franklin and Paul Jones was calculated to add luster
to the cause they served.</p>
<p>Whether Paul Jones walked in the gardens of Paris
or upon the boulevards, he was followed by a respectful
and admiring crowd. The first night he went to the
theater, as soon as he entered the word went round,
&ldquo;There is Paul Jones!&rdquo; As he advanced and took his
seat the whisper increased to a buzz, and then into an uproar,
the audience rising and applauding excitedly. Paul
Jones, with a blush upon his manly features, rose and returned
the salutations of the crowd.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">146</div>
<p>In a few days came an invitation, which was in reality
a command, to visit Versailles and to meet the king,
Louis XVI, and his queen, Marie Antoinette. Both of
them were afterward to lay down their lives on the scaffold,
but then they were in the heyday of power and magnificence.
Louis earnestly desired the independence of
America, and entertained the highest respect for the
characters of her great men.</p>
<p>On a beautiful Sunday in May, Paul Jones, with Franklin,
set off for Versailles in a plain coach. Danny Dixon,
in a brand new sailor suit, sat on the box with the coachman
and did duty for a footman. Inside sat Dr. Franklin,
in the simple dress of an American citizen. His coat
was plain but handsome, and he remarked to Paul Jones,
smiling: &ldquo;This is the coat, my friend, in which I was insulted
by Lord Loughborough. I wear it whenever I
appear as the representative of my country; and it is my
ambition to wear it upon the day that an honorable peace
is signed between America and Great Britain&rdquo;&mdash;which
actually came to pass.</p>
<p>Paul Jones wore a splendid new uniform of an American
commodore, and looked every inch a great man.</p>
<p>All along the road to Versailles, which was crowded
with magnificent equipages, with horsemen superbly
mounted, and with a great and merry populace, the carriage
containing the two Americans was pointed out with
the utmost interest. They drove slowly down the grand
avenue, and at last the palace of Versailles burst upon
their sight in glittering beauty. The terraces were of
velvety greenness, the fountains sparkled brilliantly in the
noonday sun, and the trees were in their first fresh glory
of the May.</p>
<p>A crowd of great people&mdash;courtiers and court ladies
superbly costumed, ministers and statesmen, naval and
military officers in dazzling uniforms&mdash;crowded the grand
staircase; but all made way for the venerable Dr. Franklin
and Paul Jones, for the word had sped from mouth to
mouth who they were. Respectful greetings met them
on every side, and when they entered the anteroom they
were the cynosure of all eyes.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">147</div>
<p>Presently the great folding doors of the audience
chamber were thrown wide, and an instant hush fell upon
the vast crowd of nobles and gentlemen. The king and
queen, seated in armchairs on a dais, over which there
was a canopy, and surrounded by members of the royal
family and their suite, were seen at the end of the vast
and splendid hall. By a silent motion the gentleman
usher, one of the greatest nobles in France, singled out
Dr. Franklin and Paul Jones. Both of them rose at once
and entered the audience chamber, after which the doors
slid noiselessly into their grooves until the two reappeared
at the end of half an hour.</p>
<p>Within the hall Franklin and Paul Jones approached
the king and queen with dignified composure. They
were respectful but not awed, and were much more at
their ease than half the great people who surrounded
royalty.</p>
<p>On reaching the dais upon which sat Louis XVI,
whose mild and frank countenance expressed the honest
man and the gentleman much more than the king, Dr.
Franklin bowed profoundly, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sire, I desire to present to your Majesty Commodore
Paul Jones, of the American navy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I am heartily glad to see so great a hero,&rdquo; responded
Louis. Then the same ceremony was gone
through with the queen, whose grace and beauty were
then at their zenith.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">148</div>
<p>Both of them entered into conversation with the two
Americans. Never were two men more congenial in
general tastes and opinions than the excellent Louis and
the great Franklin. Louis admired Franklin&rsquo;s genius,
and Franklin respected the king, who, although his youth
was spent in the most corrupt court in the world, yet
grew up honest, temperate, and moral. The beauty and
enthusiasm of the young queen deeply impressed Paul
Jones. Little did he then think that lovely head would
one day fall under the axe of the guillotine!</p>
<p>The king&rsquo;s chief attention, though, was bestowed upon
Paul Jones, whom he had long desired to meet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish to thank you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;for the very noble
and interesting account of your glorious cruise, that you
wrote out at my request. But, after all has been said, I
am yet constrained to ask you, how could you have accomplished
the capture of the Serapis in the face of such
enormous odds?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By hard fighting, sire,&rdquo; responded Paul Jones, with a
smile; and the king and the lovely queen both smiled at
the manly simplicity of the answer. The king then said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand that the British have tried Captain
Pearson by court-martial, and, considering the fact that
he defended himself for five hours against Commodore
Paul Jones, they have not only acquitted him, but have
made him a baronet besides. He is now Sir Richard
Pearson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; answered Paul Jones, &ldquo;if I have the good fortune
to meet him again, I will make him a lord!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this the king laughed heartily, and repeated it to
the queen; and from that Paul Jones&rsquo;s <i>bon mot</i> went the
rounds of Europe.</p>
<p>As they were about to leave, the king said to Paul
Jones: &ldquo;It is my intention to show in some marked manner
my approval of your brilliant conduct and my appreciation
of so brave an ally, and I design that you shall
receive it in your own country and among the plaudits
of your fellow-citizens. But all Europe will know it as
well.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">149</div>
<p>Paul Jones bowed his thanks, while Dr. Franklin, in a
few words, expressed the gratitude the American Government
and people would feel at honors bestowed to
their foremost naval hero. Then, with profound and respectful
bows, they left the presence of royalty.</p>
<p>Paul Jones&rsquo;s popularity was still further increased by
these marks of kingly favor, and he became the fashion
with the nobility and the court people. No assembly
was complete without him, and &ldquo;<i>le brave capitaine</i>,&rdquo; as
he was called, was surrounded by brilliant men and beautiful
women whenever he appeared in society. But what
chiefly pleased Paul Jones was the popular regard the
masses had for him, and the attentions paid him by the
French naval and military men. These, indeed, penetrated
his soul. In a very little while the honors alluded
to by the king were announced to Paul Jones
through the Minister of Marine, M. de Sartine. A magnificent
gold-hilted sword, inscribed &ldquo;<i>Vindicati Maris Ludovicus
XVI Remunerator strenuo vindici</i>,&rdquo; was presented
him, and the extraordinary honor of the cross of the
Order of Military Merit, which had never before been
given to any but a Frenchman. This last, however, he
could not accept, as an American officer, without the
permission of Congress, and therefore the cross was sent,
with a most flattering letter to the French minister at
Philadelphia, with directions that Congress be asked to
allow Paul Jones to accept it&mdash;which permission was
afterward enthusiastically granted.</p>
<p>The conferring of this last honor made Paul Jones a
chevalier of the Order of Military Merit, and he was already
the Commodore of the American Navy. But none
of these titles were used by him. His cards bore the simple
but proud name of &ldquo;<i>Paul Jones</i>.&rdquo; He needed not
titles or distinctions; and, although he appreciated them,
he knew that they could not confer any title upon him
that would add one iota to his reputation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">150</div>
<h2 id="c18"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XVII.</span></h2>
<p>The American commissioners were so poorly provided
with money that they could never secure Paul Jones
a ship worthy of him, and the best they could do was to
get the Ariel, a French sloop of war. But Richard Dale
and Henry Lunt, together with nearly all the officers
and men of the Bon Homme Richard, were available for
the Ariel, so that Paul Jones had the same splendid company
that had served under him in his last glorious cruise.</p>
<p>A singular fatality seemed to attend all of Paul Jones&rsquo;s
departures from port. He could never get the ship he
wanted, or one worthy of him; nor could he ever leave
when he wished. Contrary winds detained him in the
roads of Groix for several weeks. When the wind finally
changed, on the morning of the 8th of October, there was
every indication of squally weather.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; said Paul Jones to Dale, whom he
always treated with the utmost confidence, &ldquo;I have private
information that Sir James Wallace, in the Nonesuch
line of battle ship, is waiting for me outside; and she, you
know, is copper sheathed, and one of the finest ships in
the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it is not written, Paul,&rdquo; answered Dale, with an
affectionate smile, &ldquo;that Paul Jones is ever to be taken by
the British.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">151</div>
<p>The most affectionate intimacy had now grown up
between the commodore and his young lieutenant; and
although Paul Jones was some years older than Dale,
the young lieutenant in private called his commander
&ldquo;Paul.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_5" href="#fn_5">[5]</a>
They were like an older and a younger
brother. In public, the strictest official etiquette was
observed by both; yet when they were alone they were
like two boy friends in their tender friendship.</p>
<p>The wind increased in violence as they got out into
the bay, and by nightfall it was a roaring tempest. Then
came up a storm of which, Paul Jones himself wrote
afterward, &ldquo;until that night I did not fully conceive the
awful majesty of tempest and of shipwreck. I can give
no idea of the tremendous scene.... I believe no ship
was ever before saved from an equal danger off the point
of the Penmarque rocks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These Penmarque rocks are among the most dangerous
in the world, and lie between L&rsquo;Orient and Brest.
The gale continued to increase, and on the night of the
9th of October, when the Ariel had the Penmarques under
her lee, the storm became utterly terrific. The sky was
of a dreadful darkness, and the waves rushed up into
great green mountain slopes, with a crest of white phosphorus
that made a weird and awful glare upon the
storm-swept ocean. Black as the sky was, it seemed to
grow suddenly blacker, as a great mass of clouds went
flying over to the northwest, where it formed a terrible
bank that reached from the surface of the sea to the arch
of the heavens. The edges were of a luminous green, and
lightnings began to play upon the face of this awful cloud
bank. It spread quickly over the sky like a great black
pall, and then a blast burst forth. It was as if the cloud
were a volcano, spouting wind, rain, hail, thunders, and
lightnings. A vast grayish-white veil of rain was tossed
by the screaming wind between heaven and earth, and
rent by the forked lightning.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">152</div>
<p>The little Ariel, unable to show a single sail, staggered
along, trembling and shuddering like a human thing in
mortal terror and agony. The frightful buffeting of the
waves had opened her seams, and water poured into her
both from below and above. The shrieking of the wind
through her cordage was like the howling of a thousand
fiends. The guns broke loose from their fastenings, and
rolled over the decks with a reverberation like the thunder
which roared overhead. All night long this lasted, and
no officer or man left his post that night or closed his
eyes to sleep. The pumps were kept going, and every
effort was made to bring the ship&rsquo;s head to the wind, but
in vain.</p>
<p>It seemed as if Paul Jones was everywhere during
those appalling hours of the night, always calm, cool, and
unruffled. &ldquo;We are in the hands of the good God,&rdquo; he
said to his men, &ldquo;and if we have to meet Death, we might
as well meet him with a bold face as a sheepish one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the guns rolled about the deck, adding a new
horror and a new danger to that of rocks and waves and
storm, Dale, who had the deck, turned to Paul Jones
and said coolly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Commodore, what shall we do about these guns?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can not afford to throw them overboard,&rdquo; answered
Paul Jones; &ldquo;we may have to fight the British by
the time this storm is over. The Nonesuch may not
weather it, nor may we; this may be our last night of
life, but if we should survive, and should meet the Nonesuch,
both of us would make a shift to fight.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
<p>Dale said no more. As the ship would lurch forward
into a black abyss, while above her hissed a mountain of
water, the phosphorescent glare would cast a pale and unearthly
light upon the horrors that encompassed her. The
officers regarded her as a doomed ship, but the men had an
unshaken confidence in the seamanship of their commander.
In after years Dale declared: &ldquo;Never saw I such coolness
and readiness in such frightful circumstances as Paul
Jones showed in the nights and days when he lay off the
Penmarques, expecting every moment to be our last, and
the danger was greater even than that we were in on the
Bon Homme Richard when we fought the Serapis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the last extremity Paul Jones let go sea anchors in
the open ocean. There the tortured ship rolled and
pitched, her lower yardarms often buried in the water,
and unable, even with the help of all the anchors, to get
her head round to the wind. Toward three o&rsquo;clock in
the morning Paul Jones shouted out the order he was
never known to give before&mdash;for he was averse to cutting
away spars and throwing guns or stores overboard&mdash;&ldquo;Make
ready, Mr. Dale, to cut away the foremast!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boatswain&rsquo;s whistle could not be heard amid the
confusion and the uproar, but Dale called to Bill Green,
and in a few minutes the sailors were hacking the stout
foremast away. It fell over the side with a frightful
crash, and was swallowed up instantly. The helm was
then put hard-a-lee, and the ship came up to the wind.
But the mainmast was pitched out of the step and reeled
about like a drunken man. As the great spar pounded
the lower deck every soul on board expected it to crash
through the ship&rsquo;s bottom. At last Paul Jones ordered
that, too, to be cut away, but before this could be done
the chain plates gave way and the mast broke short off
at the gun deck, taking the mizzenmast with it. The
mizzenmast carried away the quarter gallery, and the
scene of wreck was dreadful. The Ariel, now a dismasted
hulk, rolled helplessly in the trough of the sea.
Nothing more could be done but to keep the pumps
going and to await their fate.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">154</div>
<p>Something of the indomitable spirit of Paul Jones
seems to have inspired every man under him, for he afterward
spoke of the steady, composed courage of his officers
and men.</p>
<p>Two days and three nights did he spend in the midst
of these horrors, and when, on the 12th of October, the
gale abated so that jury masts could be rigged, the ship
was almost a wreck. But it was not destined that Paul
Jones should perish on the ocean, and so he, without the
loss of a single man, made his way back to L&rsquo;Orient. It
was considered the worst storm of the century, and the
shores of Europe were strewed with wrecks and dead
bodies for days and weeks afterward.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">155</div>
<h2 id="c19"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XVIII.</span></h2>
<p>So severe was the damage done the Ariel, that she
was not able to leave port again for America until the
18th of December. As she carried a very valuable cargo
of arms, besides important dispatches, and was weakly
armed, Paul Jones was directed by Dr. Franklin, who
was still the representative of America in France, to avoid
rather than seek a conflict with the enemy. To a man of
Paul Jones&rsquo;s temperament these directions were almost
impossible to follow. But fortunately for Dr. Franklin,
and perhaps fortunately for Paul Jones&rsquo;s enemies, he had
no serious encounter until he was near the Island of Barbadoes.
He had chosen the southern passage, because his
enemies expected him to take the usual northern passage.</p>
<p>On a warm afternoon in the latter part of January, as
the Ariel was proceeding under a fair wind, a remarkably
fast sailing frigate was observed approaching on the
opposite tack. The Ariel was deep in the water with her
heavy stores, and as Paul Jones appreciated the necessity
for prudence, he rather wished to avoid speaking the
stranger, as she was tolerably certain to be a British ship.</p>
<p>The officers were all on deck examining the frigate,
when Paul Jones, who had his glass to his eye, turned to
them and said, smiling:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">156</div>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry to disappoint you, gentlemen, but I don&rsquo;t
think we can &lsquo;see&rsquo; her. She is too heavy for us, and sails
too well. It is not our own lives and fortunes that we
would stake, but the arms for the soldiers of Washington,
and that would be an irreparable loss if we were captured.
So we must cut and run for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The officers at once saw the wisdom of this, although
they would have dearly liked a brush with the beautiful
frigate. Dale, however, in turning around, caught sight
of Bill Green, with Danny Dixon by his side, and both of
them on the broad grin. Bill&rsquo;s mouth was literally
stretched from ear to ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, Green?&rdquo; asked Dale, who was a great
favorite with the veteran quartermaster, &ldquo;what are you
smiling at?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t a-smilin&rsquo;, sir,&rdquo; replied Bill, showing every
tooth in his mouth in a perfectly phenomenal grin, while
Danny openly &ldquo;snickered&rdquo; behind his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you doing then?&rdquo; inquired Dale, smiling in
spite of himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, sir, since you axes me,&rdquo; replied Bill, trying
to look very solemn, and putting up his hand to conceal
his laughter, &ldquo;the cap&rsquo;n says as he ain&rsquo;t got no notion
o&rsquo; fightin&rsquo; that &rsquo;ere craft. I reckon he <i>thinks</i> he ain&rsquo;t, but
if Cap&rsquo;n Paul Jones kin come within range o&rsquo; a British
ship without takin&rsquo; a shot at her, why, sir, my name ain&rsquo;t
Bill Green, and I ain&rsquo;t never see Cap&rsquo;n Paul Jones.
That&rsquo;s all, sir.&rdquo; At which Bill ended with a suppressed
guffaw, and Dale himself winked knowingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be careful what you say of the captain,&rdquo; said Dale,
with another wink; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s got no notion of fighting. She&rsquo;s
too heavy for us, and you know the captain never tackles
a ship that&rsquo;s too heavy for him,&rdquo; and Dale winked prodigiously
at every word he uttered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true, sir,&rdquo; grinned Bill, &ldquo;but if you&rsquo;ll excuse a
old fellow, Mr. Dale, I see you has on a new uniform, sir,
and I&rsquo;d be advisin&rsquo; of you to git out your old clo&rsquo;es, because
it jest might happen, sir, that the Britisher might
fire at us; and then, axerdentally, sir, somebody might
pull a lockstring, and the port might be open, sir, and the
shot might hit the Britisher, and then, without the cap&rsquo;n
a-wantin&rsquo; it, as knowin&rsquo; as how the enemy was too heavy
for him, he might have to fight agin his will. &rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t ornlikely,
sir, that somethin&rsquo; might come of it, and the cap&rsquo;n
may <i>have</i> to fight, sir, though he mortially hates to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dale passed on laughing, went below, and took Bill
Green&rsquo;s advice; he took off his new undress uniform, and
put on another one rather the worse for wear. Just as he
was finishing his toilet, Danny Dixon tapped at the door
of his cabin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you please, sir, the cap&rsquo;n sends his compliments,
and wants to see you on deck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a few moments Dale was on deck. As he walked
up to Paul Jones, the captain said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I looked about for you, and my boy told me you had
gone below to shift.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Dale, with a gleam in his eyes. &ldquo;We
know that you don&rsquo;t care to tackle that ship; she&rsquo;s too
heavy for us, and you never like to fight except when you
are on an equality; but all the same, as Bill Green says,
&lsquo;something may come of it,&rsquo; so I went below to take off
my uniform, which is a little too good to wear upon such
an occasion as <i>may</i> arise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Paul Jones looked sternly at Dale for a moment, and
then, in spite of himself, burst out laughing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">158</div>
<p>Nevertheless, the Ariel carried all sail to escape the
ship, which was now evidently pursuing. As darkness
came on the Ariel seemed to be gaining, and during the
night watches the officers reported that she was completely
out of sight. Just as the darkness melted into
dawn, however, Paul Jones, who had been on deck several
times during the night, appeared, and as the faint
gray of the early light illumined the sky he pointed
astern. There was the frigate, flying a British ensign,
and not more than a mile away.</p>
<p>Without drumbeat, or any noise whatever, the Ariel
was cleared for action. She was not sailing her best,
owing to her deeply laden condition, and Paul Jones ordered
everything thrown overboard that could impede
her sailing and fighting qualities. This so much improved
the sailing of the ship that she now stretched her legs in
earnest. Everybody on board felt perfectly certain that
the captain meant to fight, but as the frigate was now
plainly pursuing the American sloop of war, Paul Jones
wished to test the sailing and man&oelig;uvring of his ship
under her lighter conditions before engaging. This conduct
evidently puzzled the frigate, and the state of uncertainty
was further increased by the Ariel hoisting
British colors, but occasionally firing a stern chaser as
she ran away. At last, toward night, Paul Jones, having
made all his preparations, the Ariel hauled up her mainsail,
took in her royal yards, and waited for her enemy.
She had not yet hoisted her American colors, but her
batteries were lighted up and her ports open.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Green,&rdquo; said Dale, passing him, as Danny
Dixon appeared with a string of battle lanterns ready to
be lighted, &ldquo;it looks as if we were going to have a brush,
after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It do, sir,&rdquo; answered Bill solemnly. &ldquo;The cap&rsquo;n
mortially hated it, and it do seem funny he couldn&rsquo;t help
it when the ship was gittin&rsquo; over the water so much faster
than she was in the beginnin&rsquo;. It puzzles me, it do,&rdquo; he
added, shaking his head waggishly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">159</div>
<p>The two ships were now within hail. It was Paul
Jones&rsquo;s intention to send up the American ensign as soon
as the enemy had got near enough to recognize it in the fast
gathering gloom, but the sailor who had hoisted the British
ensign had not taken care to make fast the other end
of the halyards, so as to draw it down rapidly, and there
was some difficulty in getting the British colors down and
the American colors up. This enabled the British ship
to range up close under the lee quarter of the Ariel.</p>
<p>The short tropical twilight was fast deepening into
night, but a brilliant moon trembled in the heavens, and
the dark-blue dome was flecked with stars. The two
ships lay close to each other, like phantom ships upon
the water, but the light from their lanterns and batteries
glowed redly.</p>
<p>In the midst of a deathlike silence Lieutenant Lunt&rsquo;s
voice rang out the questions given him in a whisper by
Paul Jones, who stood near him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ship ahoy! What ship is that?&rdquo; asked Lunt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His Majesty&rsquo;s ship Triumph,&rdquo; replied the British
captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of how many guns?&rdquo; asked Lunt.</p>
<p>Everybody awaited the answer to this in breathless
silence. There was a long pause, and Lunt repeated his
question.</p>
<p>The answer came back purposely unintelligible. Officers
and men cast significant glances around. That meant
the British ship was ready to fight if the stranger should
prove an enemy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the name of your captain?&rdquo; was next asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain John Pindar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any news from the rebels?&rdquo; asked Lunt.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">160</div>
<p>This threw the British captain off his guard, particularly
as the sailor had not yet been able to get the British
colors down, and they were still flying. Captain Pindar
came to the rail of the Triumph and gave a long account
of affairs in America, which were progressing badly for
the British. After all the information possible had been
obtained, most of which was highly satisfactory to the
Americans, Paul Jones himself called out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put out your boat and come on board, bringing your
commission, so that I can see whether you are really in
the British navy or not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this Captain Pindar&rsquo;s suspicions were excited, and
it was some moments before he replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have not told me who you are, and, besides, my
boat is leaky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then the British colors came down and the
American ensign was hoisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at my ensign,&rdquo; cried Paul Jones, &ldquo;and consider
the danger of refusing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this the British captain pluckily replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will answer for twenty guns on my ship, and I and
every one of my people are Englishmen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will give you five minutes to make up your mind
to come on board,&rdquo; said Paul Jones, &ldquo;and if you do not,
at the end of that time I shall fire into you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, all at once, the people on the Triumph waked
up to their danger. The five minutes were spent in hurried
preparation by them, but on the Ariel every man was
at his station, and not one moved or spoke.</p>
<p>The five minutes being up, the Ariel backed her topsails,
ran close under the stern of the Triumph, and let
fly her broadside. The men in the tops also gave a volley.
The British, unprepared, fired ineffectively and
without order. The Triumph was so obviously at the
mercy of the Ariel that within ten minutes her colors
were hauled down and a cry for quarter resounded. Instantly
the order to cease firing was given, and the Americans
gave three cheers. But while they were yet cheering
they observed that the British ship had shaken out
her sails and was drawing ahead. The smoke of the two
or three broadsides fired hid her for a moment, and when
it drifted off the Triumph was observed to be some distance
off on the weather quarter of the Ariel, and tacking.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">161</div>
<p>Paul Jones instantly suspected the treachery of the
Triumph&rsquo;s captain, because it is a part of the code of
morals in war that a surrender should be in good faith,
particularly when quarter has been asked for and given.
The Ariel immediately set her mainsail and made after
the fleeing ship. But it was in vain. The Triumph had
too long a lead, and, the night suddenly becoming dark,
she was lost to sight. Although Paul Jones had conquered,
his prey had escaped.</p>
<p>The Americans were indignant, but indignation could
do no good. They then resumed their course toward
America, and on the 18th of February, 1781, the Ariel
cast anchor in the harbor of Philadelphia. Paul Jones
had been absent from America three years, three months,
and eighteen days. In that time he had struck terror
upon the coasts of England, Scotland, and Ireland; he
had defied the might of England, had vanquished every
enemy with which he had fought, and had made himself
one of the heroes of the sea, whose name will live as long
as ships traverse the ocean.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">162</div>
<h2 id="c20"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XIX.</span></h2>
<p>The reception of Paul Jones by the Congress at Philadelphia
was one suitable to his great services. On the
27th of February, Congress passed a resolution reciting
that &ldquo;The Congress entertains a high sense of the distinguished
bravery and military conduct of Paul Jones,
Esq., captain in the navy of the United States, and particularly
in his victory over the British frigate Serapis,
on the coast of England, which was attended with circumstances
so brilliant as to excite general applause and
admiration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That the Minister Plenipotentiary of these United
States at the Court of Versailles communicate to His
Most Christian Majesty the high satisfaction Congress
has received from the conduct and gallant behavior of
Captain Paul Jones, which have merited the attention and
approbation of His Most Christian Majesty, and that His
Majesty&rsquo;s offer of adorning Captain Jones with the cross
of the Order of Military Merit is highly acceptable to
Congress.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On the 28th of March, Congress passed another resolution
severely censuring Captain Landais, who had then
been court-martialed and dismissed the navy, and saying
of Paul Jones, after enumerating his actions: &ldquo;Ever since
Captain Paul Jones first became an officer in the service
of these States he hath shown an unremitted attention in
planning and executing enterprises calculated to promote
the essential interests of our glorious cause. That in
Europe, although his expedition through the Irish Channel
in the Ranger did not fully accomplish his purpose,
yet he made the enemy feel that it is in the power of
a small squadron, under a brave and enterprising commander,
to retaliate the conflagrations of our defenseless
towns. That, returning from Europe, he brought with
him the esteem of the greatest and best friends of America,
and hath received from the illustrious monarch of
France that reward of warlike virtue which his subjects
receive by a long series of faithful services or uncommon
merit. That the conduct of Paul Jones merits particular
attention and some distinguished mark of approbation
from the United States, in Congress assembled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the 14th of April the distinguished mark of approbation
was granted, in the form of the thanks of Congress,
as follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That the thanks of the United States, in Congress
assembled, be given to Captain Paul Jones, for the zeal,
prudence, and intrepidity with which he has supported
the honor of the American flag; for his bold and successful
enterprises to redeem from captivity the citizens of
the States who had fallen under the power of the enemy;
and, in general, for the good conduct and eminent services
by which he has added luster to his character and
to the American arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That the thanks of the United States, in Congress assembled,
be also given to the officers and men who have
faithfully served under him from time to time, for their
steady affection to the cause of their country and the
bravery and perseverance they have manifested therein.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">164</div>
<p>Following this, there were numerous letters from eminent
patriots, and a truly affectionate one from Lafayette,
ending with: &ldquo;As to the pleasure of taking you by the
hand, my dear Paul Jones, you know my affectionate
sentiments and my very great regard for you, so that I
need not add anything on that subject.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Greatest of all, came a letter from Washington himself,
which said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Delicacy forbids me to mention <i>that particular one</i>,
which has attracted the admiration of all the world....
That you may long enjoy the reputation you have so
justly acquired, is the sincere wish of,
<span class="center">&ldquo;Sir, your most obedient servant,</span>
<span class="jr">&ldquo;<span class="sc">Geo. Washington</span>.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>Upon the official examination of his report, Paul Jones
proudly answered, in response to an interrogatory, &ldquo;I
have never borne or acted under any other commission
than that of the Congress of America.&rdquo; His accounts
also showed that he had not up to that time received a
penny either as pay or subsistence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">165</div>
<p>Upon a beautiful spring day, the French minister,
M. de Luzerne, gave a grand <i>f&ecirc;te</i> at Philadelphia, for the
purpose of investing Paul Jones with the cross of the
Order of Military Merit, sent him by the King of France.
All the Congress was invited, and all of the army and
navy officers then in Philadelphia were present in full
uniform, besides the leading citizens of Philadelphia, and
entertainment was especially provided for the sailors who
had served under Paul Jones, as well as the officers. The
guests assembled in the afternoon, and at four o&rsquo;clock precisely
M. de Luzerne and Paul Jones walked together
to the center of the lawn, under a grove of noble trees.
The scene was brilliant and beautiful, the white dresses
of the women and the bright Continental uniforms of the
men showing bravely against the green turf. On a tall
flagstaff floated together the Stars and Stripes and the
<i>Fleur-de-lis</i> of France. Conspicuously massed together
were the brave blue jackets who had served under Paul
Jones and his officers, in full uniform, with the ever-loved
Dale at their head. A military band played inspiring airs
as M. de Luzerne and Paul Jones advanced to the center
of the great circle. Paul Jones, wearing the full uniform
of an American captain and his gold-hilted sword, and
carrying in his hand his blue-and-gold cap, was a picture
of manliness and modesty. His face was pale, but his
eyes were gleaming. He had fought for glory, and glory
had been lavished upon him. The French ambassador, in
a loud voice, spoke:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Patriots: His Most Christian Majesty, whom I have
the honor to serve, desiring to show his affection for the
cause of America, and for the gallant and shining conduct
of Captain Paul Jones, has directed me, as a knight of the
Order of Military Merit, to confer upon Captain Paul
Jones the cross of this noble order. This has never
before been given to any man not a citizen of France.
But were it not for Paul Jones&rsquo;s devotion to America,
well might France claim him as her son, so well has he
served her cause and that of her allies.&rdquo; Then, turning
to Paul Jones, he held up a splendid jeweled cross, and
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Therefore, I, in the name of my master, the king, do
now invest you with this cross; and may you live long
to wear this glorious emblem!&rdquo; A roar of cheers broke
forth and resounded through the still and lovely air.
The &ldquo;hoorays&rdquo; of the blue jackets, led by handsome Bill
Green, were heard over all the rest, and Danny Dixon,
the picture of a sailor, in his smart and handsome uniform,
suddenly began to dance a hornpipe in the excess of his
delight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">166</div>
<p>A mist came before Paul Jones&rsquo;s eyes. The affection,
the respect, and the admiration of the people he had
tried to serve was inexpressibly sweet to him, and as he
caught sight of &ldquo;Old Glory,&rdquo; that floated proudly in the
golden sunset light, he could say to his own heart, &ldquo;I
promised to attend that flag with veneration, and I have
done it to the best of my power, and without fear or reproach.&rdquo;
Next him stood Dale, his best beloved friend
and lieutenant. Paul Jones laid his hand on Dale&rsquo;s shoulder,
and together they watched the inspiring scene.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My captain,&rdquo; said Dale, after a moment, &ldquo;I have a
feeling here&rdquo;&mdash;he touched his breast&mdash;&ldquo;which tells me
that when the day of conflict is over, and our country
takes her stand as the greatest republic upon the earth,
you will be ranked first among those who maintained her
honor on the seas; and the name of Paul Jones will be
linked with so much glory that every American sea officer
will envy those who can say with pride, as I do, &lsquo;<i>I served
under Paul Jones!</i>&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
